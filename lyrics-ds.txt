turn on temptation, arise, tear the sky
this nightmare is everywhere, my eyes open wide
crash on through troubled waters, oceans collide
we stand alone until the end, we fight side by side
standing strong together, marching forever on
fire in the heavens, now that our time has come
we feel the fire burning bright in the night
where the warrior lives and the warrior dies
wherever you go we will be by your side
for the spirit of ninja will carry the night
the sky will turn black, the nightfall appears
the hatred surrounding they hide in great fear
the evil all around the sound they will hear
will not be for long now the time it is near
raising hell forever, still millenniums go by
fire in the heavens, bleeding ears hear the cry
we feel the fire burning bright in the night
where the warrior lives and the warrior dies
wherever you go we will be by your side
for the spirit of ninja will carry the night
standing strong together, marching forever on
fire in the heavens, now that our time has come
we feel the fire burning bright in the night
where the warrior lives and the warrior dies
wherever you go we will be by your side
for the spirit of ninja tonight
we feel the fire burning bright in the night
where the warrior lives and the warrior dies
wherever you go we will be by your side
for the spirit of ninja will carry the night
ninja forever tonight
on a cold winter morning, in the time before the light
in flames of death's eternal reign we ride towards the fight
and the darkness is falling down and the times are tough all right
the sound of evil laughter falls around the world tonight
fighting high, fighting on for the steel
through the wastelands evermore
the scattered souls will feel the hell bodies wasted on the shores
on the blackest waves in history
we watch them as they go
through fire, pain and once again we know
so now we fly ever free
we're free before the thunderstorm
on towards the wilderness our quest carries on
far beyond the sundown, far beyond the moonlight
deep inside our hearts and all our souls
so far away we wait for the day
for the lights are so wasted and gone
we feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
through the fire and the flames we carry on!!!
as the red day is dawning
and the lightning cracks the sky
they raise their hands to the heavens above
as we send them to their lies
running back through the midmorning light
there's a burning in my heart
we're banished from the time in the fallen land
to a light beyond the stars
in the blackest dreams we do believe
our destiny this time
and endlessly we'll all be free tonight
and on the wings of a dream
so far beyond reality
all alone in desperation
now the time is gone
lost inside you'll never find
lost within my own mind
day after day this misery must go on
so far away we wait for the day
for the lights are so wasted and gone
we feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
through the fire and the flames we carry on!!!
woooooah, wooooooh, wooooooooah
woooooah, woooooah, wooooooooooah
now here we stand with their blood on our hands
we've fought so hard now can we understand?
i'll break the seal of this curse if i possibly can
for freedom of every man
so far away we wait for the day
for the lights are so wasted and gone
we feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
through the fire and the flames we carry on!!!
instrumental
can you feel the pain inside sometimes in my mind?
in the land of loneliness the seas of blood run cold
is the feeling lost inside within the sins of all mankind?
time after time we stood united on we go
fly far away don't let the world pass you by
live for the day when we must stand and survive
now we face the judgment day our souls will feel the pain
hear the screams of my world through the rain
silent fields of despair my tears in the rain
pain in my heart bleeding through
one day we'll be back for one moment in time
endlessly searching for you
who can cure my emptiness inside for this time?
suffering from loneliness my dreams and hopes will die
no more feelings left inside my blackened heart i cannot hide
time after time our souls divided on we cry
fly far away don't leave your own past behind
live for the day another year passes by
now we turn to face our fear there's nothing more to say
still your dreams and my nightmares remain
silent fields of despair my tears in the rain
burning fires, burning lives
on the long distant roads
through the lost mountains endless
so far away from home
crossing battles savage seas towards the mountains high
forest plains of wilderness we're striking out tonight
on towards our destiny we travel far and wide
journey through the darkness as your hearts refuse to die
in the flames of hell we fire at will the fires of doom has come
with the forces of the blackest knights they're staring at the sun
far across the distant plains of ice we're searching for the sword
when the time has come for battle now we follow with the horde
we will ride with fire burning hot towards the night sky
in the land of long ago forever in our souls
fly on wings of shining steel are burning so bright
in ancient lands of warriors we're riding on again
burning fires burning lives on the long distant roads
through the lost mountains endless so far away from home
warrior soldiers forever we fought long ago
we're all lost in the darkness so far away from home
fallen soldiers taste the steel of death the daylight dawning
sun will shine upon the lives of burning hearts of ice
as you break through the boundaries of life this feeling of despair
and they die in their sleep for the world that will not care
you feel lost in this labyrinth of pain this sickening dismay
there's a voice inside that's calling another wasted day
can't you see the history the suffocating madness
in the land of fallen souls there's nowhere left no place to go
i have traveled far and wide across this wasteland
still searching for the answers for the right to understand
burning fires burning lives on the long distant roads
through the lost mountains endless so far away from home
warrior soldiers forever we fought long ago
we're all lost in the darkness so far away from home
riding through starlight and smashing the boundaries as hellfire falls from the sky
a shadow of pain will arise from the ashes of those fallen ones who have died
our only master with fire and fury of hell will see his bidding done
blasting from high as the battle unfolds to the gates of the city we come
we will ride with fire burning hot towards the night sky
in the land of long ago forever in our souls
fly on wings of shining steel are burning so bright
in ancient lands of warriors we're riding on again
burning fires burning lives on the long distant roads
through the lost mountains endless so far away from home
warrior soldiers forever we fought long ago
we're all lost in the darkness so far away from home
on a cold winter of morning,
in the time before the light.
in flames of death's eternal reign,
we ride towards the fight.
when the darkness is falling down
and the times are tough all right.
the sound of evil laughter,
falls around the world tonight.
fightin' hard, fightin' on for the steel,
through the wastelands evermore.
the skeletors souls will feel the hell,
bodies wasted on the shores.
on the blackest wings in hell's domain,
we watch the lands become.
in fire and flame, and once again we know.
so now we're flying we're free,
we're free before the thunderstorm.
on towards the wilderness,
our quest carries on.
far beyond the sun down, far beyond the moonlight.
deep inside our hearts and all our souls.
so far away we wait for the day,
for the light source so wasted and gone.
we feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days,
through the fire and flames we carry on!
as the red day is dawning
and the lightning cracks the sky.
they'll raise their hands
to the heavens above
who descend unto their lies.
running back through the mid morning light,
there's a burning in my heart.
we're banished from the time in the foreign land,
to a light beyond the stars.
in your blackest dreams see to the need, that destiny is tied.
and endlessly we're roaming free tonight.
and on the wings of a dream so far beyond reality.
all alone in desperation, now the time has gone.
lost inside you'll never find, lost within my own mind,
day after day this misery must go on.
so far away we wait for the day,
for the light source so wasted and gone.
we feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days,
through the fire and flames we carry on!
whoa's
now here we stand with their blood on our hands.
we fought so hard, now can we understand.
i'll break the seal of this curse if i possibly can,
for freedom of every man.
so far away we wait for the day,
for the light source so wasted and gone.
we feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days,
through the fire and flames we carry on!
suffer the raging anger creeping below
trapped in the circle, so helpless
forces beyond
this is your last chance to die
i hear a thousand voices screaming my name
dreams of a life forgotten now will be gone
never to return again
hide from the light, you feel so hypnotized
filtered and disguised
burning forever, try to remember
sadness in her eyes
so many times now we've been here before
no more illusions behind the open door
trapped within my fierce desire, resistance is futile
screaming for your life, nowhere to hide
tonight we cross the line, your innocence is mine
falling down, my life fading now to the end
one last chance of glory in my heart again
set me free from craving the one thing i can't have inside of me
but is it all a waste of time?
lost in a misery, the fatal demise
forced to a living that no one can understand
hiding behind all the lies
a long time in slavery, it cries out in vain
lurking around the shadows until the end
fearless in fatal disguise
wake from the dream, the life you left behind
time to understand
lost in the laughter, life ever after
trials of a broken man
and through this madness a new day will rise
we shall remember the pain she held inside
fear the pain inside my heart, our sacrifice in vain
screaming for your life, nowhere to hide
this everlasting strain, driving you insane
falling down, my life fading now to the end
one last chance of glory in my heart again
set me free from craving the one thing i can't have inside of me
but is it all a waste of time?
still lost in the universe, we cry for a new day to come
break free from our loneliness, the last time
pray tonight as we try to understand
falling down, my life fading now to the end
i'm alive forever, my soul will ascend
one last chance of glory in my heart again
set me free from this craving the one thing i can't have inside of me
just a memory
or is it all a waste of time?
flying over darkened skies the battle will call
distant angels crying in the eye of the storm
and the world falls under the starlight
shining from heavens below
ride the wings of pain and sorrow searching for more
gliding on the tracks of pain, just never before
and the stars fall on the horizon
onwards and up through the pain
ride the wind and fight the demon, steel shining bright
standing together forever onwards, flames burning strong
i live in hell of pain and sorrow now and never onwards
we stare into the dawn of a new world
cry out for the fallen heroes lost some time ago
in our minds they still live on when the sands of time are gone
rise over shadow mountains blazing with power!
crossing valleys, endless tears, in unity we stand
far and wide across the land, the victory is ours
on towards the gates of reason
fight for the truth and the freedom, gloria
searching through the memories to open the door
living on the edge of life like never before
when the crowd chants under the moonlight
facing their fears all the same
hell is spilling open wide enough for the core
all this time we're allied to the angels before
and the world cries out from the silence
lost in the voices unknown
i deny the force of evil, cries into the night
living before in the seas of darkness, now they're all gone
out from the shadows storming on the wings of revelations
your soul will feel no mercy behind the door
hold on for the morning after never to let go
when the fire's burning strong
and the time to try and hold on
rise over shadow mountains blazing with power!
crossing valleys, endless tears, in unity we stand
far and wide across the land, the victory is ours
on towards the gates of reason
fight for the truth and the freedom, gloria
cry out for the fallen heroes lost some time ago
in our minds they still live on when the sands of time are gone
rise over shadow mountains blazing with power!
crossing valleys, endless tears, in unity we stand
far and wide across the land, the victory is ours
on towards the gates of reason
fight for the truth and the freedom, gloria
i'm searching through emptiness
and try to forget us in vain
the light of the dark setting sun
will bring my sadness to an end
voices cry out through the fear and the dark
as we wait for our lives to be better
the words are dying in the night
no winter lasts forever
the seasons pass and the sunlight will shine
on my life again
so let the past now burn down in flames
locked in prison, in a world of living fear
on the edge of my destruction, marching on
still suffer in darkness with the dreams of life not meant to be
as i lie awake and curse the rising sun
sadness inside from the truth that she hides
and this pain in my heart for no reason
the words are dying in the night
no winter lasts forever
the seasons pass and the sunlight will shine
on my life again
so let the past now burn down in flames
stare into my eyes
i'm burning with lust and desire
wont you come down and
let yourself go in the fire
so leave the past behind
voices cry out through the fear and the dark
as we wait for our lives to be better
the words are dying in the night
no winter lasts forever
the seasons pass and the sunlight will shine
on my life again
so leave the past behind
the dark clouds fading for my mind
no pain will last forever
the seasons pass and the sunlight will shine
on my life again
so let the past now burn down in flaaaaames,
now burn down in... flaaaaames
waaaa
wah
steel of the brave hearts trapped inside
in frozen of illusion
high is the mountain we must climb
reach out for rebellion
rise up to the open sky
one chance at the price of glory
fire in a thousand blazing skies
one lifetime ascending
strong is an army, side by side
still brave and defending
march on through the tragic lands
cold tears in the north wind falling
raise your souls high
see the new dawn arise through the
sands of all time, mystery of life
everlasting sadness through lightyears gone by
land lost in time, once more back where we belong
promises of yesterday, we'll keep holding on
silent and twisted, lifeless mind
so blind in delusion
cursed by the emptiness inside
cast out in confusion
strike back with the power in hand
break free from a past life, dying
onwards we strive till
the answers we'll find in the
sands of all time, mystery of life
everlasting sadness through lightyears gone by
land lost in time, once more back where we belong
promises of yesterday, we'll keep holding on
still lost alone and i'm dying
daylight the world is still crying
evermore we'll search throughout a lifetime
stars are falling down tonight
light the path where eagles fly
find the strength inside us, a new world reborn
silent tears of pain we cried
raise our hands unto the sky
break the chains that bind us
one moment in time as we
rise up to the open sky
one chance at the price of glory
raise your souls high
see the new dawn arise through the
sands of all time, mystery of life
everlasting sadness through lightyears gone by
land lost in time, once more back where we belong
memories of life to pray for
everlasting price to pay for
promises of yesterday, we'll keep holding on
sands of all time, once more we'll rise up again
stand alone and fight 'til the end
falling gradually, endlessly the perfect disease
everyone's a winner but you're down on your knees
sanity is passing one more shot if you please
for the one final game i won't be playing
still the same tempting voice in my mind
losing grip on it all losing grip on it all
carry on through the endless lies
'cause i can't see a reason why
chorus
give me the night
let me be me for one last time
a prisoner of myself lost in disguise
just give me the night
still living in a twisted dream
there's no tomorrow for right now will be
the best time of my life
hammering, sickening, torment and pain
blind ambition to poison my brain
cheating, lying, begging, stealing day after day
for the one final dose i won't be saving
pure darkness consuming my life
don't wanna die here alone die here alone
walk away from reality
got a date with the enemy
chorus
the best time of my life!
still the same tempting voice in my mind
losing grip on it all losing grip on it all
carry on through the endless lies
'cause i can't see a reason why
chorus
yeah!
i'm searching through emptiness
and try to forget us in vain
the light of the dark setting sun
will bring my sadness to an end
voices cry out through the fear and the dark
as we wait for our lives to be better
the words are dying in the night
no winter lasts forever
the seasons pass and the sunlight will shine
on my life again
so let the past now burn down in flames
locked in prison, in a world of living fear
on the edge of my destruction, marching on
still suffer in darkness with the dreams of life not meant to be
as i lie awake and curse the rising sun
sadness inside from the truth that she hides
and this pain in my heart for no reason
the words are dying in the night
no winter lasts forever
the seasons pass and the sunlight will shine
on my life again
so let the past now burn down in flames
stare into my eyes
i'm burning with lust and desire
wont you come down and
let yourself go in the fire
so leave the past behind
voices cry out through the fear and the dark
as we wait for our lives to be better
the words are dying in the night
no winter lasts forever
the seasons pass and the sunlight will shine
on my life again
so leave the past behind
the dark clouds fading for my mind
no pain will last forever
the seasons pass and the sunlight will shine
on my life again
so let the past now burn down in flaaaaames,
now burn down in... flaaaaames
waaaa
time after time, as we march side by side,
through the valleys of evil and the torturing souls,
night after night, for the glory we fight,
in the kingdom of madness and the tales from the old!
death by our hand, for the higher command,
as the darkness surrounds us and the cries as they fall,
fire burning steel, and the tyrants will kneel,
hearts burning stronger with the power of the sword
set sail for the glory,
pray for the master of war
sunlight will fall by the wastelands
endless rise with the heroes before
cry thunder!
sword in his hand
titans of justice, fearless we stand
cry thunder!
strong in command
blessed by the union, freedom of man
reckoning day, for the demons we slay,
with the force of a dragon we will conquer them all!
chaos still reigns, in the space and the plains,
with the ultimate glory will relentlessly crawl
march on
through the hell fire
raging from the darkness beyond
nightmares return by the thousands
fearing rise, with the heroes once more
cry thunder!
sword in his hand
titans of justice, fearless we stand
cry thunder!
strong in command
blessed by the union, freedom of man
unholy darkness,
in the eyes of broken dreams,
outside of the wasted and torn,
a land of tears still remains
soldiers of destiny calling,
and the fallen will rise up again,
conquer the forces of evil and fight to the end
cry thunder!
sword in his hand
titans of justice, fearless we stand
cry thunder!
strong in command
savior of nations, freedom of man
cry thunder!
sword in his hand
warriors defending, one final stand
cry thunder!
strong in command
blessed by the union, freedom of man
blessed by the union of man!
cry thunder!
yeah yeah!
outside the battle ragin' death upon us
no surrender unchained and free
insanity will lead to blind destruction
crush the evil, the foul disease
our final destination reborn in darkness
watching and waiting destroying with ease
the judgement day upon us as dawn is breaking
mankind will fall to the spineless deceived
chorus
fly through the storm, power of the steel
striking with vengeance, force them to kneel
soldiers unite, force of the world
fight till the end we will die by the sword
fight on in foreign fields of mass destruction
stand as one, no man left behind
our final victory, tonight awaits us
slain in darkness behind the lines
raise the dead, ride beside of me
fallen heroes, of a thousand moons
blaze ahead the price that they now pay
on the march to their doom
chorus
fight till the end we will die by the sword
light the fires of freedom, on the shores of endless seas
wings of glory guide us, on the path to victory
light the fires of freedom, on the shores of endless seas
wings of glory guide us, on the path to victory
outside the battle raging death upon us
no surrender unchained and free
insanity will lead to blind destruction
crush the evil, the foul disease
chorus
silently marching, our quest for revenge
lost in the forgotten tragedy
scars of the past still alive in our veins
onwards we fight to our destiny
trample their forces we now overrun
sign of the power inside of us
cities in ruins and lives are destroyed
stand at the edge of the universe
suffering fills the open sky
battering down the pain inside
memories hide the moonlight sky
till the end of our days
conquering lands and fallen heroes
sanity torn we ride on fearless
victory sounds a thousand miles away
into this world in wonder from a starlight sky
for a lifetime of freedom, and the legend is born
once more unbroken, the price we will pay
on this march into fire, the heart of the storm
endless destruction consuming our land
legions of darkness destroy mankind
storming the wasteland we now overcome
vanquishing evil, insane we find
rise of the slain, breaking the chains
fight through the whirlwind of doom
live for the day, conquer the pain
under the light of the moon
into this world in wonder from a starlight sky
for a lifetime of freedom, and the legend is born
once more unbroken, the price we will pay
on this march into fire, the heart of the storm
outside the endless rain
crushed by the burning pain
this life goes on forever after
across the universe, on through the twilight sky
and still we feel the fire go on and on
into this world in wonder from a starlight sky
for a lifetime of freedom, and the legend is born
once more unbroken, the price we will pay
on this march into fire, the heart of the storm
outside of this world
there's a life force still burning
outside of this land
there's a star shining free
in silence we stand
on a golden horizon, calling
this time has no light for us
still shining so bright for us
again
trapped inside this paradise still bleeding
while there are so many faces in this mask of lies
blinded by the promises and the life in pain
now the time has come for all of us to rise
through the fires of hell between us
through a lifetime of our dreams
endless tears still burn inside
beneath the sadness of our screams
at the edge of our forsaken lands
sign that we stand here alone
nothing to say when the evil finally burns
we all stand in silence for the wasted and gone
one warrior standing, through a thousand years strong
our past lives still shining, the starlight reveals
our glory remembered, with the power of the steel
and the winter rain will fall, around the brave and fallen
like the sands of endless time, they'll never be forgotten
we all stand in silence for the wasted and gone
for the last time we cry now for freedom
cast aside, this dying world forsakes us
break the chains of our creation now to save our lives
blight of all eternity and the curse of steel
like the winter rain will tear the blazing skies
from the wastelands of destruction
with the fire we hold inside
rise again, still glorious
for the power of all man kind
from the years of our forsaken lands
sign that we stand here alone
nothing to say when the evil finally burns
we all stand in silence for the wasted and gone
one warrior standing, through a thousand years strong
our past lives still shining, the starlight reveals
our glory remembered, with the power of the steel
and the winter rain will fall, around the brave and fallen
like the sands of endless time, they'll never be forgotten
we all stand in silence for the wasted and gone
for the last time we cry now for freedom
for the trials of far behind us
in the dark and burning skies
fallen tears still lost inside
within the memories of our lives
from the years of our forsaken lands
sign that we stand here alone
nothing to say when the evil finally burns
we all stand in silence for the wasted and gone
one warrior standing, through a thousand years strong
our past lives still shining, the starlight reveals
our glory remembered, with the power of the steel
and the winter rain will fall, around the brave and fallen
like the sands of endless time, they'll never be forgotten
we all stand in silence for the wasted and gone
for the last time we cry now for freedom
for the last time we cry now for freedom, again
one man remains
and the stars seem to change
far beyond our universe tonight
and the cries of the brave
and the skies filled with pain
for the silent ones we pray for all tonight
new dawn rising destruction and pain
long days passing the fear of the rain
soldiers fighting on the price they will pay
nuclear meltdown the world uncertain from the
power of the tragedy of man's creation
rise from the suffering for our salvation
fearless we stand strong till the end, at the trial of all our lives
now say our final goodbyes
chorus
light the path for the journey home
save a prayer for the lost alone
find a way from the other side
before the heroes task still binding
through the long nights across the seas
shine a light for eternity
find a way beyond the other side
until the last man stands for all mankind
skies now blackened the night turns to day
nations fearful of global decay
fires still raging on in vain now we pray
nuclear fallout the fortunes fading as we
stand at the edge barren desolation
fight for the future of our generation
fearless we stand, brave we defend
for a thousand years gone by
now say our final goodbyes
chorus
chorus
and the fate of the world in our hands
rise again until the end of time
until the last man stands for all mankind
soldiers of fire
rage of the universe
cold steel and bloodshed
in the lost barren wasteland
fear rising higher,
rage of the winter war
death calls at night fall,
our hatred still burns as
we march through endless skies
mankind will fall, death will arise
chorus
for a lifetime we fight without reason,
still we wait for the warriors return
though we're cast out and broken, we still carry on
alone in a lost fallen world
woah yeah!
flames burning higher,
curse of the winter land,
black, torn, and twisted
in the fastfading twilight
storm winds still blowing
steel shapes our destiny,
death calls at night fall
our curse with be lifted
disguise this timeless crime
brave men will fall, evil will rise!
chorus
still heroes we're born with promises so blind
the light at the end of the road that we all must climb climb
for a lifetime we fight without reason
still we wait for the warriors return
though we're cast out and broken we still carry on
alone in a lost fallen world
alone in a lost fallen world
woah yeah!
on wings of burning fire across the oceans far
the legends of the seven seas and mystic fallen star
their laden ships are sailing on towards the sun
to the island of the everlasting chosen one
face our fear along the way our freedom will prevail
the crown and the shining light
punishment and anger in the fire of your soul
prepare the eternal fight
lost in a dream in a boundless sea
rivers of pain are guiding me
defending this land from the sins of man
never surrender our dreams again
ride forever onwards stare into the sun
where hopes and dreams are everlasting marching on and on
rise another day across the distant skies
where the dawn above the winter moonlight shines upon the fall of our lives
insanity sublime shall make my bleeding heart
feel cold and fearless anger rising far beyond the dark
in search of might and wisdom sacrifice our souls
in the name of truth and justice never to be told
face our fear along the way our freedom will prevail
the crown and the shining light
punishment and anger in the fire of your soul
prepare the eternal fight
can you not feel the eternal pain
flows through your heart and every vein
the torture begins and it breaks you down
nothing to save when the soul is gone
ride forever onwards stare into the sun...
flying over darkened skies the battle will call
distant angels crying in the eye of the storm
and the world falls under the starlight
shining from heavens below
ride the wings of pain and sorrow searching for more
gliding on the tracks of pain, just never before
and the stars fall on the horizon
onwards and up through the pain
ride the wind and fight the demon, steel shining bright
standing together forever onwards, flames burning strong
i live in hell of pain and sorrow now and never onwards
we stare into the dawn of a new world
cry out for the fallen heroes lost some time ago
in our minds they still live on when the sands of time are gone
rise over shadow mountains blazing with power!
crossing valleys, endless tears, in unity we stand
far and wide across the land, the victory is ours
on towards the gates of reason
fight for the truth and the freedom, gloria
searching through the memories to open the door
living on the edge of life like never before
when the crowd chants under the moonlight
facing their fears all the same
hell is spilling open wide enough for the core
all this time we're allied to the angels before
and the world cries out from the silence
lost in the voices unknown
i deny the force of evil, cries into the night
living before in the seas of darkness, now they're all gone
out from the shadows storming on the wings of revelations
your soul will feel no mercy behind the door
hold on for the morning after never to let go
when the fire's burning strong
and the time to try and hold on
rise over shadow mountains blazing with power!
crossing valleys, endless tears, in unity we stand
far and wide across the land, the victory is ours
on towards the gates of reason
fight for the truth and the freedom, gloria
cry out for the fallen heroes lost some time ago
in our minds they still live on when the sands of time are gone
rise over shadow mountains blazing with power!
crossing valleys, endless tears, in unity we stand
far and wide across the land, the victory is ours
on towards the gates of reason
fight for the truth and the freedom, gloria
close your eyes, hear the thundering rain
here inside of the torture and pain
for the cries of the world and the last lives remain
hear your heart's way to die for the game
deep inside slowly fading away
and the last breath's in vain and the fear turns to rage
locked in the world by the fallen evil souls
torn right apart from the roughly seam
breaking my mind now to bring my life to war
reach out and die with the flames
see through the lives of the red hot stabbing eyes
now is the time to defend your crown
destiny will call to remind us all
we fly free so far from here there's one thing we'll relay
and dreams of everlasting pain the fallen now rise again
through the fire, through the flames like the sun we'll rise again
lost in time, lost in space to the end of other days
see their endless ways: insanity
the quest will rage, not meant to be
in flames of hell forevermore eternally
chorus:
so free your heart leave your life far behind
in the cold dark winter skies escape the pain inside
now feel your soul lost in scenes of all eternity
every day of this life, defending
and the flames of youth not ending
in a lifetime, searching, we must fight through the eternal pain
so alone in the world far away, memories of the dream will remain
as the world's falling cold and your life's all in vain
fire in your soul will forever rise again
nothing in your mind to remember now
held here by the fear of the dark land calling
fly free on endless seas, the final curtain falls
on the ground from down below, the time to lock and to load
through the fire, through the rain, far across the distant plains
feel the wind beneath the steel as your mind becomes insane
save the hate of all humanity, their eyes belong to destiny
for freedom now we rise alone again
chorus:
so free your heart leave your life far behind
in the cold dark winter skies escape the pain inside
and when the memories are all left behind
and the days are gone forever, lost within my mind
now feel your soul burn in scenes of all eternity
every day of this life, defending
and the flames of youth not ending
in a lifetime, searching, we must fight through the eternal pain
we fight through the eternal pain
proud and so glorious, standing before of us
our swords will shine bright in the sky
when united we come to the land of the sun
with the heart of a dragon we ride
we are flying on wings in winter sky
with fire burning deep inside
we are warriors of endless time, forever and on
on wings of steel an ancient flight
we see the powers that unite
the gods will now send us a sign of battles once more
through the valley we ride, full of glory we soar
where the fights will be raging, for now and for more
when united we come and divided they fall
tonight you will witness it all
proud and so glorious, standing before of us
our swords will shine bright in the sky
when united we come to the land of the sun
with the heart of a dragon we ride
a land unknown, we come so far
we ride the night till morning star
when colours fade to black and white
your eyes come to sight
with the vision of a great divide
you turn towards the other side
you think you run but you can't hide
the dead can not ride
through the valley we ride, full of glory we soar
where the fights will be raging, for now and for more
when united we come and divided they fall
tonight you will witness it all
proud and so glorious, standing before of us
our swords will shine bright in the sky
when united we come to the land of the sun
with the heart of a dragon we ride
over high seas and mountains
we fly to the heavens
on wings of a dragon tonight
proud and so glorious, standing before of us
our swords will shine bright in the sky
proud and so glorious, standing before of us
our swords will shine bright in the sky
when united we come to the land of the sun
with the heart of a dragon
the heart of a dragon
the heart of a dragon we ride
spending all our lives
on what we believe in
struggle day by day
but never retrieving
taking our chances
and follow the footsteps
ancestors will take us to this fight
at the time it was blistering snowing
never really knew about
where we were going
time has come now
to cross over
here and now until
the curtain lowers
slaying all the evil down below
onwards we ride now
to what we know
strong enough to stay
and carry on forever
brace your soul
to fight whenever
never know how far we travelled
we will have our stand
across the deepest oceans
gold is in our hands
good things will come
for those who wait we can't deny
still the battle raging and the fire burns inside
take you with me, we will fly across the sea
to the land of the sun where our journeys begun
all fear is gone, we sail until the dawn
deepest fears will burn inside your mind
for the souls lost in endless time
searching never ending
for the chaos ascending
you forgot the spirits
all times pretending
passing shades of darkness
in the world around you
finally insanity
in death has found you.
on the edge of life
trying to pull you under
deep inside the storm
there's a raging thunder
sacrifice your innocence
for persecution
as we now prepare
for the revolution
slaying all the evil down below
onwards we ride now
to what we know
strong enough to stay
and carry on forever
brace your soul
to fight whenever
in a time of fire we're searching
blind inside the mind
run away to hell's damnation
one day we will find
suddenly the skies are falling
too late for us all
crashing down on all creation
as the towers fall
take you with me, we will fly across the sea
to the land of the sun where our journeys begun
all fear is gone, we sail until the dawn
deepest fears will burn inside your mind
for the souls lost in endless time
stand before the worlds of freedom
rise above the war
ride towards the battle raging
victory behold
blackened steel of death tonight
our legions now descend
far beyond the gates of glory
time to rise again
take you with me, we willy fly across the sea
to the land of the sun where our journey's begun
all fear is gone, we sail until the dawn
deepest fears will burn inside your mind
take you with me, we will fly across the sea
to the land of the sun where our journey's begun
all fear is gone, we sail until the dawn
deepest fears will burn inside your mind
for the souls lost in endless time
for the souls lost in endless time,
whooaaooh
for the souls lost in endless time
in the darkness of the night in the shadows of the dawn
it's turning black no looking back the sands of time are sown
when the day will slowly end and the sun has turned to grey
will we feel the power of freedom with the dawn of a new day?
over mountains paved with gold and through the valleys of the slain
our quest will lead us onwards to the journey of the brave
when the time has come to stand for the power we believe
we will ring the sound of victory for one and all to see
sometimes in your darkest dreams you will feel the haunting pain
silent tears of your hidden fears come to haunt you once again
fight on for the memories of the everlasting dream
their in the silent lands on wings of glory free
we can go on forever with the darkness so far away
and the warriors who live forever fight on to the end
across the highest mountains and through the endless seas
our journey ever onwards fight until we all be free
through the darkness shining the never ending light
on through the days of glory rise towards the fight
and one day we will find a way toward this distant golden age
the cries of war will sound the day
we stand before the dawn of a new world
on through the raging thunder across the seven seas
cold winter skies are falling on the battles we have seen
we can go on forever with the darkness so far away
and the warriors who live forever fight on to the end
across the highest mountains and through the endless seas
bursting through the fires of empty
fatal warrior, battles are raging
power of darkness rise for the fight
we're strong and stand our ground
death is all around us and my heart is beating weaker
fight the demon, power of immortal souls arise
fire in our hearts the evil rages on for evermore
burning in the cold the battle rages now
through damnation rise, sign of the times
master of bleeding eyes
thunder and high, look to the sky
they're never gonna take us down!
chorus:
and we will cross the evil standing
on the temple in the fire
storming there beyond the lost horizons, oh
heroes of the night are calling
see the promised land is falling
reaching for the powers deep inside
on through the night
blinded by the hate and desire
burning in your heart like a fire
challenging you  suffer and fear
horizons seek control
blood spills all around us
and our enemies grow nearer
sacrifice your life to have
the journey you will ride
take us to the plains of death and carry on for evermore
riding on the wings of memories long gone!
and you'll die for your crimes, sign of the times
master of endless lies
fight to the end, now we ascend
together we will take them down!
chorus:repeat 2x
smashing through the boundaries
storming through the burning fields
stand before the evil one
look towards the morning sun
falling under skies of pain
soul is searching endlessly
crashing over seven seas,
torture in the winter skies,
riding over plains of ice,
shadows in the fields of the slain!
crashing steel and raging fury
smash the glass destroy the army
crush the legions of the twilight
give us our steel on the way
cry far away as we reach for the day
blasting our way through the punishment and the pain
reach for the war as the sky begins to fall
rising through the darkened ashes
we'll never see our world
far away and ever onwards see the day
for today the everlasting eternal sun
washed away the dreams of a brighter day
forever hold the dream inside
the chance to fight another fight
the breaking hearts will stand for all our lives
with tonight, woah, woah?
watch you die, i watch you die inside
while fate controls your life
and reject this animosity
that's piercing every mind
you feel the power, do believe
the fear you hold inside
choose to find a reason for the treason
now you will be mine
screams of pain are not the same
and rise again from hell, defending
power of hearts within the fire
warriors of hell fear the slain
rise through the pain
and the sun will rise again,
day after day but the memories never change
stand before the storm as the last horizon falls
riding on the wings of hell
the innocence of our souls
far away and ever onwards see the day
for today the everlasting eternal sun
washed away the dreams of a brighter day
forever hold the dream inside
the chance to fight another fight
the breaking hearts will stand for all our lives
with tonight, woah, woah?
far away and ever onwards see the day
for today the everlasting eternal sun
washed away the dreams of a brighter day
forever hold the dream inside
the chance to fight another fight
the breaking hearts will stand for all our lives
with tonight, woah, woah?
yeah!
we come from
over the dark horizon sky
with twisted tales of sacrifice
to imagine or believe all the glory of the free
hunting all day an endless cry
the things i've seen i can't deny
sinners, saints all mixed in one
the dawn of time has begun
why can't you see what they're doing to me
is it fair that i'm dying in vain
once in a land of sacrifice now only valleys of demise
shadows of a pale blue moonlight ride the waves of entity
why can't you see what they're doing to thee
is it fair that you all die in vain
ride with the steel and the power of the sword
stand up and fight now and forever more
rise through the night sky with daylight's desire
to be free there must be black fire
through the day and through the night with dragons heart the warrior strikes
this is the day that they'll be known as my enemy
why can't you see what they're doing
to what we believe in we rise through the pain
ride with the steel and the power of the sword
stand up and fight now and forever more
rise through the night sky with daylight's desire
to be free there must be black fire
we come from distant lands we travel so far
can you see the bleeding scar
the prizes of life we fail to win
'cause we doubt the power within
why can't you see what they're doing to
what we believe in we rise through the pain
ride with the steel and the power of the sword
stand up and fight now and forever more
rise through the night sky with daylight's desire
to be free there must be black fire
black fire
silent screams and shattered dreams awash with this insanity
still lost within the misery and pain that lies inside
here alone the fight to breathe still searching for the truth to be
blackened by the burning fire held deep inside my mind!
far beyond the lost horizon standing on the shore
across the seas their hearts will bleed
there's laughter waiting for?
taste the steel in pain we live
for glory we defend
their fallen souls will rise to fight again!
stand here with me, this night we'll be together
future in our hands we'll fight with freedom glowing here
stand here with me for we will live forever
tonight we'll stand and face it all
falling rain will hide the pain that lies beneath the burning flames
all hope is gone so carry on before the world will fall
rise again to die in vain now life can never be the same
our own salvation drawing near, i hear the darkness call
skies are falling, thunderstorm and stand before the world
we're banished now to barren wastelands, fight the demon, oh
riding on through black and darkness, cross the endless sands
we sail away, our victory at hand!
stand here with me
together we'll be stronger
side by side we conquer lands
and storm across the seas
die here with me
we feel this pain no longer
for now and never we will live
chorus
in my heart, in my soul, i am out of control
fly across the mountains and towards the distant sun
tears evermore we cry like before
feel the breakdown of my body ? just set me free
chorus: repeat 2x
feel the breakdown of my body
just come and set me free
dark clouds and thuderstorms in the fires and flames were born
through darkness travelling on the night
hellfires and rain will fall time is coming for us all
our journey for the guiding light
firelight it is burning so bring in the dark of the night
as we fight for the glory tonight there's nowhere to hide
on the wings of your destiny brings all the power you crave
carefull now if not you then who else will we save
lost in this world a total stranger
death by the sword a common danger
you know that everything is not what it seems
march on all night forever searching
daylight ahead is only lurking
break through the walls and use the power of your dreams
once in a lifetime take a chance at the right time the dgolory you see
rise up for the time of your life
now the time has come for you to be free
in minds of society we all live in harmony
truth is that we all die in vain
you stand for what you believe
i kill for what i concieve
is there then a title for this game
far way in the wastelands of hell full of torment and pain
demon knights riding over the heights where fallen are slain
violent fury of firestorming death now no life will prevail
now you live all your days in the fires of hell
lost in this world a total stranger
death by the sword a common danger
you know that everything is not what it seems
march on all night forever searching
daylight ahead is only lurking
break through the walls and use the power of your dreams
once in a lifetime take a chance at the right time the glory to see...
on a cold winter of morning,
in the time before the light.
in flames of death's eternal reign,
we ride towards the fight.
when the darkness is falling down
and the times are tough all right.
the sound of evil laughter,
falls around the world tonight.
fightin' hard, fightin' on for the steel,
through the wastelands evermore.
the skeletors souls will feel the hell,
bodies wasted on the shores.
on the blackest wings in hell's domain,
we watch the lands become.
in fire and flame, and once again we know.
so now we're flying we're free,
we're free before the thunderstorm.
on towards the wilderness,
our quest carries on.
far beyond the sun down, far beyond the moonlight.
deep inside our hearts and all our souls.
so far away we wait for the day,
for the light source so wasted and gone.
we feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days,
through the fire and flames we carry on!
as the red day is dawning
and the lightning cracks the sky.
they'll raise their hands
to the heavens above
who descend unto their lies.
running back through the mid morning light,
there's a burning in my heart.
we're banished from the time in the foreign land,
to a light beyond the stars.
in your blackest dreams see to the need, that destiny is tied.
and endlessly we're roaming free tonight.
and on the wings of a dream so far beyond reality.
all alone in desperation, now the time has gone.
lost inside you'll never find, lost within my own mind,
day after day this misery must go on.
so far away we wait for the day,
for the light source so wasted and gone.
we feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days,
through the fire and flames we carry on!
whoa's
now here we stand with their blood on our hands.
we fought so hard, now can we understand.
i'll break the seal of this curse if i possibly can,
for freedom of every man.
so far away we wait for the day,
for the light source so wasted and gone.
we feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days,
through the fire and flames we carry on!
can you imagine that it's all up to you?
evil embrace of powers unnatural
you're left in silence nothing more to behold
you close your eyes, and visualize an evil getaway
it's here, it's near
i see it all so clear
tonight your flight will take you higher
it's here, it's near
you live a life of fear
tonight's the night that will inspire
crying alone at night your destiny unknown

i see it all so clear
tonight your flight will take you higher

faces filled with torment
your heart beats like a drum
never will you look back again
you'll fight on 'til the end
together we will live on
forever more
in this land we have defended from all things dark and cruel
now we are defenseless in a land where dragons rule
in this land we have defended from all things dark and cruel
now we are defenseless in a land where dragons rule
flash of steel in the midday sun
the battle has begun
blood spills all around us but still we carry on
no mercy we will show to them
the white flag shall be raised
we'll fight for our freedom
ride towards this evil place
we all stand until the end allegiance to this game
in this land we've defended from all things dark and cruel
now we're defenseless in a land where dragons rule
in this land we've defended from all things dark and cruel
now we're defenseless in a land where dragons rule
sun set in the western sky
the battle's almost done
the victory will be glorious
our enemies are gone
falling from the sky now, a sign of the burning sun
into the face of the evil one
nowhere to hide now we're on the run right before your eyes
we're watching, we're waiting, our souls are forsaking
the sign of the warriors, where we will arise
through the fire and the flames, breaking the chains
into the night we go
time to pay, time of the slain
such as the death we know
prechorus
our steel will shine forever through the dark and falling rain!
we'll see them face their fears it's time to rise again in everlasting pain
chorus
fly free for what we believe
one thousands hearts bleeding the eternal dream
feel me the judgement of me
so silently now they will heal  cry for eternity
see now the fallen are new again,
we feel the pain burn inside their head,
remember now what to be again, deep down inside
still cursing, still crawling, we're endlessly falling
the downfall of mankind, the fate of the sun
hold your head to the sky, bleeding we cry
screaming into the night
fire and pain, beginning again,
onwards to help me now!
stand strong we'll live forever
raging through the barren lands
our eyes have seen the sorrow
far across the stars, the power in our hearts
chorus:
fly far away to the end of our days
the voices of long distant cries
now we remain in this labyrinth of pain
and so we ride into the night
prechorus
chorus:
cry for eternity
on a cold dark winter night
hidden by the stormy light
a battle rages for the right
for what will become
in the valley of the damned
a warrior with sword in hand
travels fast across the land
for freedom he rise
and the sign from the master on high
he screams a loud and across hear the cry
for the kingdom of fire and ice
and the power to be alive
four strong ride on carry on through the war
four strong carry on living for ever more
on the wings of death
by the hands of doom
by the darkest light
from the darkest moon
crossing silent seas
over mountains high
all will stand as one tonight
on the black wind forever
we ride on together
destroying your evil with freedom my guide
when the master will call us
he stands high before us
our hearts filled with splendour
our swords will shine over the light
in the valley of the damned
days breaks with golden strand
over pastures green it glows
to where night returns
on the shadows faces appear
warriors wearing full metal gear
join together one and all
before the glorious light
rise up gather around come and hear what is said
use your senses open your mind don't you ever forget
on the wings of life
by the hands of hope
by the brightest light
from the brightest sun
crossing silent seas
over mountains high
to the valley of the damned
on the black wind forever
we ride on together
destroying your evil with freedom my guide
when the master will call us
he stands high before us
our hearts filled with splendour
our swords will shine over the light
on the black wind forever
we ride on together
destroying your evil with freedom my guide
when the master will call us
he stands high before us
our hearts filled with splendour
our swords will shine over the light
life is a misery, don't know how it's come to be
death, the epitome of all of our days
in the past we had no choice to hear or to be the voice
close your eyes and visualize the demon to arise
you know that sanity is not as it was meant to be
and now that misery has taken a new stand
in the land of a thousand souls we will carry on through the rain
in the sun we will move along with the memories of the slain
when i see this humanity and the evil that they have come to be
we've come to the point of no return and you beg for just...
one more time to escape from all this madness
one more time to be set free from all this sadness
and one last time to be the one who understands
my soul and my spirit will go on, for all of eternity
foreign the currency, your payment in blood to be
death is the destiny for all of our ways
in the dark you hide away for who or what you can't say
when i see the power of the demon come alive
you know that sanity is not as it was meant to be
and now that misery has taken a new stand
on the wings of eagles flying staring on to the sun
reaching for the gold horizon when the war shall be won
can you see the debauchery and the blade of death that has come for thee
in winds of torment forever more you will cry for just...
one more time to escape from all this madness...
here we are, far beyond the distant sky
seen all the world and how the story will be over
through the snow and tainted mountains we have climbed
now we have found the light that guides us over
through the falling rain we travelled far and wide
and through the blackest darkness, stars above shining bright
through the sun and winter rain will fall
all our lives we all were waiting for a sign to call
we're walking hand in hand in dreams of endless time
how do we know when we will leave this life behind?
stare at life through eyes of mine
the hate, the fear and the pain
there's a feeling held deep inside
when life you live is in vain
fly away down the lonely roads of yesterday
we close our eyes to see the light of brigther days
and all alone we'll be where time can never heal
with the trail of broken hearts flying free
once again we walk this lonley road
there are times that we were wading through the rain and cold
we're lost in memories of what we left behind
relive the dreams, the endless screams of pain inside
lives are filled with emptiness
the fear returns once again
searching endlessly, now we will see
drown your mind in the pain
fly away down the lonely roads of yesterday
we close our eyes to see the light of brigther days
and all alone we'll be where time can never heal
with the trail of broken hearts flying free
the last temptation will be all that's left for me
when i see those tears you cried
when i hear those lies you lied
when i feel all creation now falling down on me
is this the reason to be?
fly away down the lonely roads of yesterday
we close our eyes to see the light of brighter days
and all alone we'll be where time can never heal
with the trail of broken hearts flying free
since the darkness took our minds
they burned our courage, many died
had to leave it all behind, rebuild our lives
passing memories remained
it made my soul a burning flame
haunted dreams of my desire
reveal my name
raise our swords, we fight for life
shields and armor shining bright
strike like dragons, we have no fear
our swords are made of steel
fly across the high seas and mountains
rise above the golden horizon
far away beyond the gates of space and time
through the wastelands forever and on
still we fight on for our freedom
the cry of the fallen souls bleeding
forever journey through the lands of ice and snow
will we face all the fears of the world?
the cry of the brave
since the time we saw the sign
destruction of your feeble mind
centuries have come and gone but nothing's changed
hopes and dreams have disappeared
destruction of your kind is near
trapped inside your suffering eternal flame
search the darkness, search the light
fierce resistance, what a fight
glory for unholy seal
lies all cast in steel
fly across the high seas and mountains
rise above the golden horizon
far away beyond the gates of space and time
through the wastelands forever and on
still we fight on for our freedom
the cry of the fallen souls bleeding
forever journey through the lands of ice and snow
will we face all the fears of the world?
the cry of the brave
in the depths of your desire
so secretly you feed the fire
burning through the memories of all our lives
watch the day turn into night
you reach out for that guiding light
first to be the one to hear their blinding lies
fear of darkness, fear of light
sucked in by their ancient might
ruthless in what you may feel
when your mind they steal
fly across the high seas and mountains
rise above the golden horizon
far away beyond the gates of space and time
through the wastelands forever and on
still we fight on for our freedom
the cry of the fallen souls bleeding
forever journey through the lands of ice and snow
will we face all the fears of the world?
the cry of the brave
we are riding for the battle field in force tonight
fury of the darkest evil cry for war
far beyond the boundaries of hell and starlight
on the road to lands unknown forever more
through the caverns far below our quest will lead us
onwards through the ice and snow forever more
standing fighting full of hate the time has come now
stand and sound the guns of glory cry for war
on wings of glory we will carry on
far across forgotten lands towards the distant sun
and in the darkness shinning far beyond the starlight
lightning is striking from the dark dawning shadows
and in the kingdom of the everlasting sun
when the glory of the master's time has come
into the fires of forever we will fly through the heavens
with the power of the universe we stand strong together
trough the forced of power, it will soon reach the hour
for victory we ride, fury of the storm!
we are the chosen one we can not fail now
spilling all the blood on the fires below
smashing through the boundaries with the fire and fury
killing all the mortals down the winding road
hell fires are raging the storm growing strong
on the path to victory towards the distant sun
and in the darkness shinning far beyond the starlight
lightning is striking from the dark dawning shadows
and in the kingdom of the everlasting sun
when the glory of the master's time has come
burning fires burning lives on the long distant roads
through the lost mountains endless so far away from home...
crossing battles savage seas towards the mountains high
forest plains of wilderness we're striking out tonight
on towards our destiny we travel far and wide
journey through the darkenss as your hearts refuse to die
in the flames of hell we fire at will the fires of doom has come
with the forces of the blackest knights they're staring at the sun
far across the distant plains of ice we're searching for the sword
when the time has come for the battle now we follow with the horde
we will ride with fire burning hot towards the night sky
in the land of long ago forever in our souls
fly on wings of shining steel are burning so bright
in ancient lands of warriors we're riding on again
burning fires burning lives on the long distant roads
through the lost mountains endless so far away from home
warrior soldiers forever we fought long ago
we're all lost in the darkness so far away from home
fallen soldiers taste the steel of death the daylight dawning
sun will shine upon the lives of burning hearts of ice
as you break through the boundaries of life this feeling of despair
and they die in their sleep for the world that will not care
you feel lost in this labyrinth of pain this sickening dismay
there's a voice inside that's calling another wasted day
can't you see the history the suffocating madness
in the land of fallen souls there's nowhere left no place to go
i have traveled far and wide across the wasteland
still searching for the answers for the right to understand
burning fires burning lives on the long distant roads...
riding through the starlight and smashing the boundaries as hellfire falls from the sky
a shadow of pain will arise from the ashes of those fallen ones who have died
our only master with fire and fury of hell will see his bidding done
blasting from high as the battle unfolds to the gates of the city we come
solos  twin blast  sam  herman  herman  herman  vadim  sam  herman  sam  vadim  herman  herman  herman, sam & vadim
i hear a distant thunder. they say thou don't surrender
witnessing lael my eyes the sins of our land
why can't we see from under? dark reign on thou defenders
endlessly torturing the sons without stand
fight out lets break the chains so strong we must feel no pain
forever torn apart from the haunting fields of man
raging fear from skies above the fire fill my veins
destruction of humanity the everlasting flame

we'll show no mercy as they fall the fire burns inside
now prepare for war!

towards the battering and rise all the time

we will sail on, forever on
to the land of the evening star
into the endless we ride
unveil the darkness behind
abandoned glory hidden, castaway we ride
now will the sky surrender?
forever through the never
a silent whisper echoes through my restless heart tonight
and i will see the glory rise
we'll be one tonight
don't you shut your eyes in silence
tonight gather near, come and live your fear
in a land of desire, your heart filled with fire
you live for the right to be free
we will sail on, forever on
to the land of the evening star
in a land of desire, your heart filled with fire
the land of the evening star
now and forever after
asylums filled with laughter
suspicion haunts my dreams
an echo through my mind
this starlit gaze reminds me
are you so blind you can't see?
the winds of change my friend
will blow for you in the dead of night
and i will see glory rise
we'll be one tonight
don't you shut your eyes in silence
tonight gather near, come and live your fear
in a land of desire, your heart filled with fire

the land of the evening star
in a land of desire, your heart filled with fire
the land of the evening star
day after day as i bodies slay
and the sun becomes dark in the sky
everything's lost for this human race
and the dawn of a new age will rise
rays of sunlight now are gone
only visions of ice will remain
the fallen ones and forgotten souls
will rise up over the slain
no more hope
as we raise our hands to the sky
no more dreams
as the rivers run dry
everything's lost all is left astray
only sorrow and sadness remains
the curtains have dropped on our fallen world
and the forces of darkness shall rise
why can't you see what has happened to thee
can you not open your eyes?
everything's lost there is no retreat
and the valleys echo with pain
no more hope
as we raise our hands to the sky
no more dreams
as the rivers run dry
on the endless sea of madness we sail forever more
and the endless tears of sadness towards the distant shores
when the flame has died forever we stand one and all
with the power of the almighty sword
we fight the battle on the fields tonight
to save us from the master of all evil sign
and to the battle on,
forever standing strong
we feel the fire power of the night warriors
no more tomorrow
dying of sorrow
over the mountains and up through the trees
traveling across seven seas
no more hope
as we hold our hands to the sky
no more dreams
as the rivers run dry
on the endless seas of madness we sail forever more
and the endless tears of sadness towards the distant shores
when the flame has died forever we stand one and all
with the power of the almighty sword
we fight the battle on the fields tonight
to save us from the master of all evil sign
and to the battle on,
forever standing strong
we feel the fire power of the night warriors
on the endless seas of madness we sail forever more
and the endless tears of sadness towards the distant shores
when the flame has died forever we stand one and all
with the power of the almighty sword
we fight the battle on the fields tonight
to save us from the master of all evil sign
and to the battle on,
forever standing strong
we feel the fire power of the night warriors
coming down from the mountain on high
towards the battle we go side by side
our hearts are filled with honour and pride
cause we know our time has come
silent voices down from below
rising up through the ice and the snow
ancient angers cast upon all
through the lands of the slain
through the dark night and through the rain
fighting machine we have risen again
stronger than all the world we arise...
stand and fight, join the light
into the battle with power and might
sound the guns, raise the cannons of war...
with the north star to guide us
we ride on the sky
blazing up through the heavens
like eagles we fly
and the horsemen shall come
they will judge all your lives
revelations will now be unveiled
darkened night set to the swallow the light
all is lost there's no one left to fight
overpowered by the glory and might
of the ones who stands tall
fallen heroes scattered around
deafened ears opens up to the sound
painful cries rising forever more
from the victims of life and of war
through the dark night and through the rain
fighting machine we have risen again
stronger than all the world we arise...
stand and fight, join the light
into the battle with power and might
sound the guns, raise the cannons of war...
with the north star to guide us
we ride on the sky
blazing up through the heavens
like eagles we fly
and the horsemen shall come
they will judge all your lives
revelations will now be unveiled
no more hope of freedom
our dreams are washed away
the second age is coming
the dawn of a new day
the judgement stands before us
the second king will rise
our swords will shine with honour
as hatred fills the skies...
with the north star to guide us
we ride on the sky
blazing up through the heavens
like eagles we fly
and the horsemen shall come
they will judge all your lives
revelations will now?
with the north star to guide us
we ride on the sky
blazing up through the heavens
like eagles we fly
and the horsemen shall come
they will judge all your lives
revelations will now?
revelations will now?
revelations will now be unveiled
outside on a winter's night as the rain begins to fall
there's a chill in the air and the howl of a wolf while the rain beats at the door
seven kings will ride on the wind up towards the mountains high
and the only sound that will break the air is the warrior's bitter cry
when the dawn of a new day will see the light then the strongest hearts grow old
and the warrior stands on top of the hill in the snow
dark night with a glimmering light in the distance up ahead
in the forest they dwell with a misty spell no one heard what once was said
and the eagle fly through the clouds while earth bleeds dark and cold
when the voices of men will ring out again all creation shall unfold
when the colour of night will fade to light and the weakest hearts go cold
and the warrior stands on top of the hill in the snow
and we're standing one and all fighting till we fall
hoping for a better day never giving in
until we find the words till we find the words to say
until we find the words to say
burning starfire shine in the sky
for the lives of great men who stand by your side
when the night fall on we will ride
for no lost souls will live on forever
dark night on the valley below still the horsemen follow through
it's a forest that leads to the foot of the hill that inside the magic holds
seven strong they ride on along to the place where sorrow lies
and the shadows of the night will no longer hide all their mysteries come undone
when the colour of night will fade to light and the weakest hearts go cold
and the warrior stands on top of the hill in the snow
and we're standing one and all fighting till we fall
hoping for a better day never giving in
until we find the words till we find the words to say
until we find the words to say
burning starfire shine in the sky
for the lives of great men who stand by your side
when the night fall on we will ride
for no lost souls will live on forever
and we're standing one and all fighting till we fall
hoping for a better day never giving in
until we find the words till we find the words to say
until we find the words to say
burning starfire shine in the sky
for the lives of great men who stand by your side
when the night fall on we will ride
for no lost souls will live on forever
for lost souls will live on forever
on a cold winter morning
in the time before the light
in flames of death's eternal reign
we ride towards the fight
when the darkness has fallen down
and the times are tough alright
the sound of evil laughter falls
around the world tonight
fighting hard, fighting on for the steel
through the wastelands evermore
the scattered souls will feel the hell
bodies wasted on the shore
on the blackest plains in hell's domain
we watch them as they go
through the fire and pain and once again we know!
so now we're flying we're free
we're free before the thunderstorm
on towards the wilderness
our quest carries on
far beyond the sundown
far beyond the moonlight
deep inside our hearts and all our souls!
so far away we wait for the day
for the lives all so wasted and gone
we feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
through the fire and the flames we carry on!
as the red day is dawning
and the lightning cracks the sky
they'll raise their hands to the heavens above
with resentment in their eyes
running back through the midmorning light
there's a burning in my heart
we're banished from a time in a fallen land
to a life beyond the stars
in your darkest dreams see to believe
our destiny is time
and endlessly we'll all be free tonight!
and on the wings of a dream
so far beyond reality
all alone in desperation
now the time has gone
lost inside you'll never find
lost within my own mind
day after day this misery must go on!
so far away we wait for the day
for the lives all so wasted and gone
we feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
through the fire and the flames we carry on!
now here we stand with their blood on our hands
we fought so hard, now can we understand
i'll break the seal of this curse if i possibly can
for freedom of every man!
so far away we wait for the day
for the lives all so wasted and gone
we feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
through the fire and the flames we carry on!
burning fires, burning lives
on the long distant roads
through the lost mountains endless
so far away from home
crossing battles savage seas towards the mountains high
forest plains of wilderness we're striking out tonight
on towards our destiny we travel far and wide
journey through the darkness as your hearts refuse to die
in the flames of hell we fire at will the fires of doom has come
with the forces of the blackest knights they're staring at the sun
far across the distant plains of ice we're searching for the sword
when the time has come for the battle now we follow with the horde
we will ride with fire burning hot towards the night sky
in the land of long ago forever in our souls
fly on wings of shining steel are burning so bright
in ancient lands of warriors we're riding on again
burning fires burning lives on the long distant roads
through the lost mountains endless so far away from home
warrior soldiers forever we fought long ago
we're all lost in the darkness so far away from home
fallen soldiers taste the steel of death the daylight dawning
sun will shine upon the lives of burning hearts of ice
as you break through the boundaries of life this feeling of despair
and they die in their sleep for the world that will not care
you feel lost in this labyrinth of pain this sickening dismay
there's a voice inside that's calling another wasted day
can't you see the history the suffocating madness
in the land of fallen souls there's nowhere left no place to go
i have traveled far and wide across this wasteland
still searching for the answers for the right to understand
burning fires burning lives on the long distant roads
through the lost mountains endless so far away from home
warrior soldiers forever we fought long ago
we're all lost in the darkness so far away from home
riding through the starlight and smashing the boundaries as hellfire falls from the sky
a shadow of pain will arise from the ashes of those fallen ones who have died
our only master with fire and fury of hell will see his bidding done
blasting from high as the battle unfolds to the gates of the city we come
in a lifetime of decay
sudden cry for yesterday,
when the world will see the end of eternity
sacrifice before the dawn
of a child soon to be born
before the night too many tears we cried
in a long forgotten land
through the silent raging pain
of the price to pay that awaits for me
the end of all our destiny
don't close your eyes tonight
for the lights beyond still shine towards a brighter day
the time has come for us tread blood across the sands
carry on as the red rivers run
and through the wilderness we feel the pouring rain
in the silence ever searching on through the misery
and all the promises we made and cried in vain
don't you take the time to realise the master of disguise?
blind my eyes burning forever to wash my sins away
out of the dark pain is the price
fly away out of the raging storm
lost within my memories
still haunting me
a never ending story
far and wide forever on
stand before the world alone we journey to the other side
raise your hands to the sky
through the night and through the day
don't look back no time to pray
the battle rages on marching on and on
don't cry for me tonight
for the lights beyond will guide me home tomorrow
the time will come for us the curse is growing strong
carry on with the rise of the sun
so take me far away it's time to set me free
all my life i have been waiting but i could never see
raising your hands to the sky
turning your eyes to the sun
pray for forgiveness
the power to save has gone for the last time
blind my eyes burning forever to wash my sins away
out of the dark pain is the price
fly away out of the raging storm
lost within my memories
still haunting me
a never ending story
blind my eyes burning forever to wash my sins away
out of the dark pain is the price
fly away out of the raging storm
lost within my memories
still haunting me
a never ending story
chorus
one dream in all of us still shining,
one star, the ever lasting light,
so alone, so lost inside, to the ending paradise,
united, victorious, the hearts of our nation tonight.
in the dark december morning light,
far strong to the burning winds, the fires of hell will forsake me,
shattering the chains that ever bind us,
suffering their pain eternally.
for strong, smash the silence, carry on like before,
fires burn, still we battle, lost so far away,
storm with hail fire raging, sun shines down as they kneel,
lost in times and long forgotten, governing miles away.
tears fall inside the dream, our last days gone by,
still alive we feel the pain tonight,
stars fall through blackened clouds, and dreams that miss rains,
a twilight star in the thousand lights for me.
chorus
and still we save a breath for the world,
life brings up for us all,
united, victorious, the hearts of our nation tonight.
one dream in all of us still shining,
one star, the ever lasting light
chorus
and still we save a breath for the world,
life brings up for us all,
united, victorious, the hearts of our nation tonight. repeat: x2
sonic fires bring mass devastation,
manic search in sad desperation,
jeopardise the right to hide from a sad existence,
nothing left, still searching for something,
deep beneath the cries
wait for the deafening silence, fly forever more.
crushed by the thought that you're all alone, cravation in her eyes,
i will be waiting tomorrow,
striving to understand, wasting a life not meant to be,
twisted and so broken once again,
and the promises we cast away will shine a guiding light,
victim of your grief and denial.
take my hand, this one last time,
face the world before us, the warrior inside,
in a lifetime of disaster, it's a battle to the end,
final stand, my life must carry on,
and forever, this time
battered, beaten, forced to submission,
stricken by your fatal decision,
suddenly it's time to say your last goodbyes,
misery remains voluntary, all illusion gone,
break through the blistering madness,
free forever more.
blinded my eyes with your filtering mutation cast aside,
i'll still be waiting tomorrow,
stand to a toxic man, forced to a life of yesterday,
theatre of salvation crushed and burned,
down this lonely road, recede the day our dreams are brushed,
can't regain this emptiness in time.
take my hand, this one last time,
face the world before us, the warrior inside,
in a lifetime of disaster, it's a battle to the end,
final stand, my life must carry on,
and forever, this time
see through the skies,
far beyond the road tonight,
here the sounds of freedom ring,
in a silent dream, and a million miles away.
see through the skies, far beyond our world tonight,
hear the sounds of freedom ring,
in a silent dream,
and a million miles away
reach for the stars,
and live our lives forever free,
in our hearts for a thousand years,
and a thousand lifetimes before
and the dawn of a new day will rise, a light for us all
all before our time now,
we always lived freely.
we lived a very long life,
but armageddon is on the path to death.
meteorites will rain down,
destroying our family and friends.
fire raging down on our precious homes,
oh god please stop the armageddon.
armageddon, armageddon!
please don't destroy us.
we want to live peacfully with our earth,
armageddon, armageddon ending!
we will never live again,
not even be reborn.
we're all comitting suiscide baddly,
so that way we won't have to face the facts.
facing earthquakes from hell,
the biggest volcanic eruptions.
tsunami hurricanes and tornados,
flooding our precious o precious earth.
oh, will this rampaging end ever stop,
already we are dieing from armageddon.
we are all killing others,
and then killing ourselves, because of armageddon.
armageddon, armageddon!
will this raging fire ever stop.
please oh god help our earth from death,
armageddon, armageddon ending.
so it seems that we can't survive,
so goodbye now to you.
armageddon, armageddon ending!
armageddon, tis time for the end of the world!
strangers to reason, our bleeding hearts so cold,
life brings a change it seems, fear will blind the soul,
in the silence one only will know,
cast away can it fall on the wastelands.
send the soul from the forgotten sickness, and save his life,
challenge the dream before the long departing, your mind is right,
hear the burning thunder roar,
still lost in a fire storm,
tonight we feel the past return.
lost inside the dream, beside the life we'll live forever,
still the wasted time that burning we love,
one thousand shattered voices, lost inside an endless wonder,
tonight her voice will take me home.
shine glorious we ride, we stare into the blackened sky,
save the last command, the virtue blinding,
so far beyond the sun, still blinded with the fire inside,
once alone again, silence stands for our last journey home.
our lives intensified, mutation, frustration,
ever lasting lifetime in beyond the world,
we'll travel endlessly, they're moving, he's jointed,
one man can understand his sad misery.
they've taken my heart,
they've taken my soul,
and now we stand below in sanity.
in time we'll see the past unwind,
alive, still wander in a fallen land,
one more time we stare into the blackened sky,
for tonight, in our hearts now we feel,
one last time see our destiny reveal.
shine glorious we ride, we stare into the blackened sky,
save the last command, the virtue blinding,
so far beyond the sun, still blinded with the fire inside,
once alone again, silence stands for our last journey home.
shine glorious we ride, we stare into the blackened sky,
save the last command, the virtue blinding,
so far beyond the sun, still blinded with the fire inside,
once alone again, silence stands for our last journey home.
silence stands for our last journey home.
finally all the world will see.
rise again before the endless silence.
burn your soul before we'll all be free.
light the path beneath the blackened, burning sky!
one final sacrifice, this night belongs to me.
turn back before the dawn of winter.
so far away the cries set fallen angels free.
through my mind tonight our journey ever after.
never ending solitude this is the life to be.
so cold and dark the voice of sadness.
suffering in endless pain the truth of all to be,
crawling back to life through ever blinding darkness.
bridge
free falling, fate's warning, find the life to hold on.
soul stealers, true believers, spies now they are gone!
and as they ride away, forsake the ones who save us,
winter's dawning on a lost, fallen god.
pray now, united in a lifetime, hold on.
won't you wait for the silence so strong. wait for the dawn.
chorus
tonight! falling like the rain insanity lives on.
feel the shattered dreams, one thousand voices crying.
raging endlessly they come.
whoa! and the morning light will hide another day's gone by!
and the sun will shine again across the blazing sky!
glorious, eternally, we'll rise above the world.
marching onto victory, we fight. the fire still burns!
looking back our past the lives, their memories to see.
flick through the passages of silence.
hidden by the sacrifice to set the demons free,
now they understand, reclaim the land, relentless.
fear calling, transforming, stand alone in our time.
bridge
abdication, decimation, slay the vision divine!
and all the stars fall around the world tonight.
silent forces from a past life return.
pray for the silence in a world so alone
till we touch the horizon beyond.
fly through the storm!
chorus
the tears in your eyes.
a lifetime of misery.
in silence we stand all alone for the fate of our own destiny.
a lifetime of lies.
one chance at this fantasy.
the judgment will pass for the cries of the world that has faded for me.
chorus
lost in a dream, finally it seems,
emptiness and everlasting madness,
see the sadness grow, watching as we know,
blinded for our journey for the world,
call for us, the power in all of us,
so far beyond the blackened sky tonight
glorious, forever more in us,
we are victorious, and so alive.
we'll all find our sacrifice tomorrow,
our journey on towards a brighter day,
silent tears we left behind, still so far away,
across the endless sands,
through the fields of our despair,
dream for all eternity, we stand, yeah,
rise above the universe tonight,
starchaser
fly towards the storm, see the world reborn,
feel the pain inside, the voice, the sorrow,
across the distant shores, find the open door,
stand alone, in judgment for tomorrow.
years of pain still haunt us all, we saw the last sunrise,
take me home, in freedom, for a lifetime...
praying on for the silence, and the last tears will blind,
so glorious, this fight inside, united we stand.
we'll all find our sacrifice tomorrow,
our journey on towards a brighter day,
silent tears we left behind, still so far away,
across the endless sands,
through the fields of our despair,
dream for all eternity, we stand, yeah,
rise above the universe tonight,
starchaser
free from this world, here for the last time,
oceans collide inside of us all,
believe who we are,
the phoenix will guide us,
freedom will rise once again.
save us tonight, the last hope for all of us,
lightyears gone by, we're still holding on,
save us tonight, a star shines in all of us,
far beyond our lives, still our glory lives on.
we'll all find our sacrifice tomorrow,
our journey on towards a brighter day,
silent tears we left behind, still so far away,
across the endless sands,
through the fields of our despair,
dream for all eternity, we stand, yeah,
rise above the universe tonight,
starchaser
our kingdom come, we stand as one,
and we will live for always evermore
strangers they come with the rise of the sun,
to escape from this madness forever,
rivers will dry, bringing holes in the sky,
as the empire is fading away.
silently watch now, and the lost souls run wild,
in a time long forgotten, forever,
hate brings us sadness and the dawn of the world,
but this nightmare will still carry on.
through the day we'll find a way, we're lost beneath the stars,
faceless they follow, and we all stand as one,
long wasted tears, but the laugh forever shining,
one stand one last command to end it all.
outside the world in a fallen land, turn away from my despair,
we stand alone in a silent dream, lost within eternity,
rise again and try to understand
the light for the world will save us tonight,
redemption still so far away,
marching on inside of our loneliness,
still searching for all that remains
and time pass me by,
the light not so far away,
will the sons of the night, now our blood runs into the ocean,
tomorrow we're gone, our souls rising up to the sun.
the light for the world will save us tonight,
redemption still so far away,
marching on inside of our loneliness,
still searching for all that remains
it's just one wasted life, in one wasted land,
suffering so far, and so alive,
it's just one wasted man, in one wasted land,
until the end of time,
inside the winter storm.
outside the world in a fallen land, turn away from my despair,
we stand alone in a silent dream, lost within eternity,
rise again and try to understand
the light for the world will save us tonight,
redemption still so far away,
marching on inside of our loneliness,
still searching for all that remains
it's just one wasted man, in one wasted land,
suffering so far, and so alive,
it's just one wasted man, in one wasted land,
until the end of time,
inside the winter storm
inside the winter storm
highway of emptiness outside the burning world,
rise again this quest for our salvation,
running faster, the savage laughter, the daylight fades away,
nothing left but the life we left behind,
ever searching the hidden faces, the inside,
broken by down the fire below destroyed.
light years away, actuals between us,
so eternal wait, say goodbye for the last time tonight,
still lost within the lonely, distant lifetime ago,
hanging on as we pass through the fields,
these pieces of our lives will lead the long journey home,
and alone stand the hills.
chorus
so fly for the last time, and the fire burns within,
silently we stand in a long forgotten wasteland,
rise through the lost ages, hope they will bring,
free forever more and the dream will never die.
devil's station, the lost connection, the beatdown man returns,
so confused and alone for one more time,
crush defeated, the force surround me, the prisoner trapped inside,
system down field with intimate tonight.
time after time, promises of freedom,
we'll leave the past behind and strike for the first time tonight,
still mystified, my life all creation they show,
after all of the tries we've been through,
these memories and empty words were all lost in vain,
and the scars never heal.
chorus: x3
whoa, oh, oh,
and the dream will never die.
once again i'm here alone, my secret life awaits me
still a thousand miles away from a land of broken dreams
night falls and the screen is shining, force deception behind the lines
hours wasted aimlessly gone, time and time again
try to understand, desperately lost with a dream in my hand
will you wait alone for me tonight?
hold me, save me
a star shines in all of us, we'll search for all our lives
one day we'll find a way, and a reason to survive
cry for the day to return, life no one can understand
we all face our fears in the world
we all hold our place in the universe
for eternity
hide the lines deceive myself, erase the past from my space
images of loneliness sent far across the land
once sure, but my eyes are blinded
frantic charge for a place to hide
lost generations apart, an ancient life returns
kindness in her eyes, taken away by a man in disguise
won't you wait alone again tonight?
save me, take me
a star shines in all of us, we'll search for all our lives
one day we'll find a way, and a reason to survive
cry for the day to return, life no one can understand
we all face our fears in the world
we all hold our place in the universe
for eternity
try to understand, desperately lost with a dream in my hand
will you wait alone for me tonight?
hold me, save me
a star shines in all of us, we'll search for all our lives
one day we'll find a way, and a reason to survive
cry for the day to return, life no one can understand
we all face our fears in the world
we all hold our place in the universe
for eternity

"uh, we got a killstreak coming up if anyone's interested."
it's getting late at night by a freezing moon
the time is running out and the end is soon
an army in despair, don't know what to do
impure thoughts are raging in this empty room
the victims are escaping, now we shall regroup
the times are getting tougher as we face our doom
a circus of horrors waiting just for you
the barrel's bottom, anything will do
so take my hand and i will lead you right into
extraction zone, the zone
you can make yourself at home
extraction zone, your zone
you don't have to feel alone
where dreams become reality
and standards will now cease to be
so live your life in the extraction zone
another place, another time, we carry on
not getting any easier 'cause we're getting on
a creature from another world, it's gone all wrong
a circus of horrors waiting just for you
the barrel's bottom, anything will do
so take my hand and i will lead you right into
extraction zone, the zone
you can make yourself at home
extraction zone, your zone
you don't have to feel alone
where dreams become reality
and standards will now cease to be
so live your life in the extraction zone
as a new dawn will rise
i promise myself, not again
but deep in my heart
the fire still burns just the same
it's just the same
a circus of horrors waiting just for you
the barrel's bottom, anything will do
so take my hand and i will lead you right into
extraction zone, your zone
you can make yourself at home
extraction zone, the zone
you don't have to feel alone
where dreams become reality
and standards will now cease to be
so live your life in the extraction zone
life's uncertain, a ratrace of pain
endlessly searching for more
hopeless and needless, held back the chains
'till we can't take anymore
hold on, stay strong
breaking out from the past life fading
no more, what for
all we got is to keep on praying
pray for the done for, the lives in dismay
witness the final decay
suffering in silence for years we were blind
but now we git something to say
hold on, stay strong
'till the end a fate of dying
no more, what for
nothing left but to keep on fighting
united, incited, not misguided
we'll fight through time before our one true destiny
benighted, ignited, still strong and undivided
this day foretold now here for all to see
so free in the blue skies with time marches on
once more maybe we'll find our peace to behold
strangers in a strange world, defenders through time
cursed in our kingdom of unholy fire
legends of darkness will be on the grave
spill their blood under the sun
voices are calling with anger and rage
the final war now has begun
hold on, stay strong
'till the end a fate of dying
no more, what for
nothing left but to keep on fighting
united, incited, not misguided
we'll fight through time before our one true destiny
benighted, ignited, still strong and undivided
this day foretold now here for all to see
so free in the blue skies with time marches on
once more maybe we'll find our peace to behold
strangers in a strange world, defenders through time
cursed in our kingdom of unholy fire
hear our call, save us all
standing tall tonight
the flame will slowly fade away
the shadows of our lives
will ash away the memories
before the last sunrise
we'll keep holding on
in the sands of changes
standing strong against the winds
until the end of time
hold on, stay strong
'till the end, not afraid of dying
no more, what for
nothing left but to keep on fighting
united, incited, not misguided
we'll fight through time before our one true destiny
benighted, ignited, still strong and undivided
this day foretold now here for all to see
so free in the blue skies with time marches on
once more maybe we'll find our peace to behold
strangers in a strange world, defenders through time
cursed in our kingdom of unholy fire
hear our call, save us all
standing tall tonight
hear our call, save us all
standing tall tonight
another night
another inner fight
the demons calling
my soul is dark
but with a touch of light
the whole world's changing
i draw the line
my pleasure redefined
it's now awakening
i feel the urge
emotions on the verge
and now its time to
kill
kill
kill
kill
the speed of light
i feel the time is right
i've smashed all boundaries
my skull is crushed
adrenaline is rushed
the night has found me
infection spread
a spirit through my head
the time is coming
i know the score
but i gotta have have 'em all
and all more i could
kill
kill
kill
kill
i am what i choose to be
i lose grip of reality
and i have nothing to atone
all your morals formed in vein
and now my pleasure is my pain
but i'm gonna make it all my own
own own
the sun is up
but i can't get enough
the skies the limit
i'm on the top
but i ain't gonna stop
ill never give in
it's in my brain
it's driving me insane
hallucinations
"always the same"
but i ain't gonna save
destruction! i must
kill
kill
kill
kill
i am what i choose to be
i lose grip of reality
and i have nothing to atone
all your morals formed in vein
and now my pleasure is my pain
but i'm gonna make it all my own
own own
i've seen the sun rise once again
i've lived my life and now i'm dead
time to come down all on my own
own
this is nothing new for me
this is my reality
so open your eyes
and don't ever hide away
i am what i choose to be
i lose grip of reality
and i have nothing to atone
all your morals formed in vein
and now my pleasure is my pain
but i'm gonna make it all my own
own own
out here on my own
love is a burning thing
and it makes a fiery ring
bound by wild desire
and i fell right into a great ring of fire and
and i fell into a burning ring of fire
i went down, down, down as the flames were rising higher
it burns, burns, burns,
and it burns, burns, burns,
the ring of fire
the taste of love is sweet
when hearts just like ours meet
i fell for you like a child
but i jumped right in and the fire went wild
when i fell into a burning ring of fire
i went down, down, down as the flames were rising higher
and it burns, burns, burns,
and it burns, burns, burns,
the ring of fire
love is a burning thing
and it makes a fiery ring
bound by wild desire
and i fell right into a great ring of fire
and i fell into a burning ring of fire
i went down, down, down as the flames were rising higher
and it burns, burns, burns,
and it burns, burns, burns,
the ring of fire
inception
death's guiding us the way
we fight till the end
among the ruins
illusion
of brighter days ahead
through confusion and hatred, we try to understand
in silence, we stand alone
caught in the eye
a quest for life beneath a stormy sky
the strength to rise again
time to realize
our race has come to nothing
we'll start it all again
the sun is dead now
fading away forever
the darkness prevails now
but with the prayers of the dead
now a new light ascends from the stars
confusion
the sadness and the pain
matricide, the earth is now dead
remember the brighter days
when hope and joy were shining in our hearts
times have changed now, we suffer yet try to understand
in silence, we stand alone
caught in the eye
the fragments of my past to realize
it's time to rise again
in the world's demise
our race has come to nothing
we'll start it all again
the sun is dead now
fading away forever
the darkness prevails now
but with the prayers of the dead
now a new light ascends from the stars
the sun is dead now
but in the end, what did we learn?
the sun is dead now
fading away forever
the darkness prevails now
but with the prayers of the dead
now a new light ascends from the stars
now a new light ascends from the stars
hiding in the fog
where darkness meets the moonlight
i will sing a melody 'til the morning comes
living for you only
take my hand and show me
there will be much sorrow when the morning comes
fearless i'm fighting the pain burns inside of me
find the forces of my soul
no one can understand me
am i condemned to ride the blackest night alone?
tragic painting on the walls
in this castle where affliction reigns
so many died in vain
hear their distant cries
never again!
this is my symphony
my dark blessing falls from the skies
i hear the voice
rising from the void
of the memories gone by
dark is the path for me
i'll find my peace another way
under the stars where we'll shine again some day
torment and sadness unleashed through these corridors
fear is leading to the night
bloodline of vampires doomed to fulfill their need
once united by the light
father! look into my eyes
i shall kill you tonight to avenge
all those who died in vain
hear their distant cries
never again!
this is my symphony
my dark blessing falls from the skies
i hear the voice
rising from the void
of the memories gone by
dark is the path for me
i'll find my peace another way
under the stars where we'll shine again some day
this is my symphony
my dark blessing falls from the skies
i hear the voice
rising from the void
of the memories gone by
dark is the path for me
i'll find my peace another way
under the stars where we'll shine again some day
'til the stars where we'll shine again some day
'til the stars where we'll shine again some day
the light is shining
still i'm not so surprised
one thousand voice mails
for one thousand lies
blind faith, lost trust
all along it was plain to see
years passed, lost touch
leads the path to insanity
take another shot, show me what you got
it was never gonna last forever
open your eyes, try and realize
once is enough so tonight now i say
no more, from a voice that breaks the awkward silence
no more, never heard so loud before
made the same mistakes a thousand times
never meant to be like this so i say
no more tonight
and it feels all right
dark nights, long passed
waking up from a pointless dream
brighter days, brighter times
hides the fatal reality
questions, answers
false addiction to nothing real
lights fade, crushed to dust
desperation in tragedy
take another shot, show me what you got
it was never gonna last forever
open your eyes, try and realize
once is enough so tonight now i say
no more, from a voice that breaks the awkward silence
no more, never heard so loud before
made the same mistakes a thousand times
never meant to be like this so i say
no more tonight
and it feels all right
no more same old game we play together
no more time will pass, we'll still remember
no more but tonight this game is over
no more strangers in the night forever
no more, from a voice that breaks the awkward silence
no more, never heard so loud before
made the same mistakes a thousand times
never meant to be like this so i say
no more tonight
and it feels all right
and it feels all right
her dream was to shine on the screen
felt that was why she was born
left all behind without a fear inside
but sometimes there's no lucky star to help you
sun will go down, and she's all alone
can't help but feel insecure
she'll never stop, the way to the top
is more than she had bargained for
her quest for the glory was real
but somehow it turned out all wrong
heartache was never a part of the dream
can't find a reason to keep on trying
turn out the lights, 'cause deep in the night
just like the thousands before
hold up your hand, there's hope at the end
but be careful what you wish for
now the lights are all gone
you find yourself on your own
welcome the night, 'cause not all that glitters is gold
now the city has gone
you find your own way back home
keep up the fight, and you'll find your kingdom of gold
another night out on the streets
finding a way to survive
wasting your chances, destroying your dreams
counting the tears that you cried
hiding the pain that drives you insane
but still you're craving for more
so give me your hand, hold on till the end
and you can have what you wish for
now the lights are all gone
you find yourself on your own
welcome the night, 'cause not all that glitters is gold
now the city has gone
you find your own way back home
keep up the fight, and you'll find your kingdom of gold
now the lights are all gone
you find yourself on your own
welcome the night, 'cause not all that glitters is gold
now the lights are all gone
you find yourself on your own
welcome the night, 'cause not all that glitters is gold
now the city has gone
you find your own way back home
keep up the fight, and you'll find your kingdom of gold
messed up, once again
told me it's okay
but this path that i'm taking
i'm lost in the deep end
one last chance, never more
told me it's all right
in this sea of denial
i'm cleansed in the fire
so why is it me
am i blinded or too blind to see?
am i too blind to see?
why was i born?
not a part of this society?
again and again i tried
so hard, to reach for the stars
but i failed you all
tried to keep standing tall
never had a real chance at all
but still i'm searching
same thing, different day
tried to make a change
left with nothing more to live for
but everything to die for
humanity, insanity, the everlasting grip
lost all will to keep trying
our bed we must lie in
so why was i born
not a part of this society?
again and again i tried
so hard, to reach for the stars
but i failed you all
tried to keep standing tall
never had a real chance at all
but still i'm searching for
ten thousand ways to say sorry
but life writes its own tragic story
time marches onwards and
nothing can ever be the same
but we'll pray for a brighter tomorrow
break free from this lifetime of sorrow
years pass us by but we're all just a part of the game
i tried so hard
to reach for the stars
but i failed you all
tried to keep standing tall
never had a real chance at all
but still i'm searching
for ten thousand ways to say sorry
but life writes its own tragic story
time marches onwards and
nothing can ever be the same
but we'll pray for a brighter tomorrow
break free from this lifetime of sorrow
years pass us by but we're all just a part of the game
candles burning, the hours turning
a countdown the day that we're born
don't look backwards, keep driving forwards
the rose withers but not the thorns
if you want it, then you can take it
just seize it before it's too late
and if all fails, get back on your feet
there's always another today but still we'll
pray for one last chance to prove we all belong
through the dark nights and cold days while time marches on
in this life, we're running out of days
we're running out of time, ignoring it's a crime
no regrets, just one shot at glory
is all we got before we die
sands of time are slipping through our hands
so try and understand and do it while you can
don't look back, just one shot at glory
is all it takes to feel alive
anger rising, relentless fighting
but soon you'll be finally free
find your way through this endless maze
be the one that you wanted to be
pray for one last chance to prove we all belong
through the dark nights and cold days while time marches on
in this life, we're running out of days
we're running out of time, ignoring it's a crime
no regrets, just one shot at glory
is all we got before we die
sands of time are slipping through our hands
so try and understand and do it while you can
don't look back, just one shot at glory
is all it takes to feel alive
fear not a twisted future, no matter what it brings
can't you see now, you're all tomorrow's kings
tomorrow's kings!
pray for one last chance to prove we all belong
through the dark nights and cold days while time marches on
in this life, we're running out of days
we're running out of time, ignoring it's a crime
no regrets, just one shot at glory
is all we got before we die
sands of time are slipping through our hands
so try and understand and do it while you can
don't look back, just one shot at glory
is all it takes to feel alive
lost long ago through the ages of time
once ruled immortal, the guardians of light
bonded together, they stood side by side
storm winds brought darkness, the world in decline
quest for their hammers to reclaim the throne
three brought together by warriors unknown
united to vanquish all hell from the earth
conquering glory, the kingdom's rebirth
raise your swords, sound the final war cry
stand, fight, fight for your lives
thousands will die but their deaths not in vain
now reunited our world may be free once again
three hammers high, in the burning red sky
forged in the fire, protectors of mankind
three hammers high, for the world we unite
fight for our lives, as we hold up the three hammers high
long have we travelled through forgotten lands
from coldest valleys to burning red sands
restless we ride through the depths of all hell
triumph and agony, death will prevail
raise your swords, sound the final war cry
stand, fight, fight for your lives
strike back with vengeance, 'til death we defend
until the day that the dragons will rise once again
three hammers high, in the burning red sky
forged in the fire, protectors of mankind
three hammers high, for the world we unite
fight for our lives, as we hold up the three hammers high
strike down the unbelievers
march on for justice we now stand
once more the path for glory
take back the power in our hands
long years of terror and the long years of pain
still marching onwards 'til victory's ours once again
victory's ours once again
three hammers high, in the burning red sky
forged in the fire, protectors of mankind
three hammers high, for the world we unite
fight for our lives, as we hold up the three hammers high
who is your god  is he not mine?
who is your devil  are we the same?
what makes you worse
what makes me better
never to trust again  how long have i got?
in this darkened maze
they keep me awake  they scream at night
screams at night
who is your master
in this shallow grave
born to die for a lie
i have no soul  i have no pride
genocide
where is justice in this hell?
where is liberty  i paid the price
my life blood runs dry
slowly drained from me
screams at night
...alone in this shallow grave i die...
a greater darkness, my mind's possessed
disillusioned, numb emptiness
no hope, i feel a paralyzing fear
no salvation faking control
their coldness hurt me beyond belief
dominus beo spiritus
will i burn, will i be free?
the great darkness consumed my soul
diabolus libero spiritus
blind my eyes, i hate the light
despair, frustration, regret
fighting, fighting for what?
lies, your lies, i feel dead inside
my pain is all i leave behind
dominus beo spiritus
will i burn, will i be free?
the great darkness consumed my soul
diabolus libero spiritus
a shadow the only light i followed
transparent i am like, like a ghost
a far cry from whom i wanted to be
i never found my place, my place nor peace
dominus beo spiritus
will i burn, will i be free?
the great darkness consumed my soul
diabolus libero spiritus
so now the bridges are burnt
a lesson learned?
promises broken
tender lies softly spoken
changes in you
changes in me
maybe it was never meant to be
it wasn't you
it wasn't me
we were far too close to see
instrutmental
instrumental
the end is near, panic is closing in
sick with fear, they run
watch freedom's fall
what have we become? cannon fodder
reign of terror, enslave the nations, devastation
this is war, pull the trigger
one nation under their control
rise, the tyrants rise
the enemy inside, the tyrants rise
the end is here, feel it closing in
blood runs red
watch in horror, our lives destroyed
we failed
the final holocaust
enslave the nations, annihilation
this is war, pull the trigger
one nation out of control
rise, the tyrants rise
the enemy inside, the tyrants rise
war, pain, suffering
the price we pay to stay alive
blood, fire, death
his glory come, his kingdom rise
this world will burn, burn, burn, burn
rise, the tyrants rise
the enemy inside, the tyrants rise
breathing life into these mares where enemies turn into flesh
this is the abyss i fear the most  i feel their eyes staring at me
waiting with carnivorous patience, their memory timeless
for all they know i must succumb sometime...
a solemn cry rises to the sky as heavy wings blacken out
the morning sun with infinite darkness. am i dreaming or am i dead?
in search for my heart  lost in this hell
the vultures are soaring above  tearing me apart
screaming voices in my head. a sudden pain then deadly silence
devouring the remains of my heart  i can feel it dying
picking at the bones of my soul
left me dead inside
the more i gave the more they took
left me dead inside
a precious child with an innocent mind
born to suffer, in this life or for another
so hopeless and relentless falls this remorseless day
the dark remains of a violent world
the day you died my tears ran dry
i feel you, i hear you echo in my soul
i failed you, i miss you so
the day you died echoes in my soul
this world's on fire, turned its back on us
a lost horizon left behind
so hopeless and relentless falls this remorseless day
the dark reality of a hostile world
the day you died my tears ran dry
i feel you, i hear you echo in my soul
i failed you, i miss you so
the day you died echoes in my soul
the day you died my tears ran dry
i feel you, i hear you echo in my soul
i failed you, i miss you so
the day you died echoes in my soul
i am forced to creep down the path
of my sad and senseless life
darkness surrounds me
at the end of the tunnel there is no light
a blackened void, nothingness
lament of a mortal soul
who am i?
only dust in the blowing wind
am i dying?
my name dies slowly
echoes into eternal oblivion
replaced by others, castly forgotten
i hate my empty existence
i don't know
i cannot see
who we are now
how we used to be
is it you?
or is it me?
look in the mirror
we are a fading memory
where are we?
we got lost
in the cold
i will live again you'll see, tomorrow's not scaring me
far away from yesterday, just take this pain away
fatal chaos
hurtful lies
a broken dream
is all we left behind
is it you?
or is it me?
look in the mirror
just a fading memory
where are we?
we got lost in the cold
i will live again, you'll see
tomorrow's not scaring me
far away from yesterday
just take this pain away
i will live again, you'll see
tomorrow's not scaring me
far away from yesterday
just take this pain away
i will live again, you'll see
tomorrow's not scaring me
far away from yesterday
just take this pain away
i will live again
you'll see, you'll see
this earth speaks of darkness
to come in the blood of man
the air breathing poison
all waters running black
until the sun rises and sets on death
the sky burns red like sheer hate
the light in our eyes will fade
to join the darkness of our souls
the earth is losing its light
night falls fast
watch the dying sun
we are lost
no angel dares to land
in this hell of mankind's making
buried all beauty in our foulness
nature begins to shine its fury
until the sun rises and sets on death
the sky burns red like sheer hate
the earth is losing its light
night falls fast
watch the dying sun
night falls fast upon mankind
pray for the dead

instrumental
instrutmental
fearless on my final quest
find truth beyond the flesh
fleeting past my dreams of unfulfilled desire
my strength unwavering
my journey just beginning
a desperate race through the corridors of hell
chaos emerges  surrender i will not
the last enemy is falling
here i am  to conquer death itself
the last enemy is falling
here i stand  to conquer death itself
funeral silence beneath the burning cross
my immortal soul sleeps with the wolves tonight
skin and bones that rot my blood runs dry
see me die to rise with the gods again
defy...decay
arise again
chaos emerges
surrender i will not
i spit in your face, preacers and leaders
spewing false dogma to their believers
a nation of wolves haunting the sheep
their fangs in your flesh
so painful and deep
despise your heroes
living a lie
despicable heroes
fooling the blind
open your mind
puppets on strings, face on the ground
nothing more than a shallow farce
consume the young, thoughtless ones
eat their brain, leave them blind
and then destroy
i spit in the face of your preachers and leaders
spewing false dogma to their believers
a nation of fools, nothing but sheep
their fangs in your flesh, so painful and deep.

since the day that you were born the wheels are in motion
turning ever faster
play your part in the big machine
the stage is set, the road is chosen
you fate preordained
we are watching you, every step of the way
never too late to stand your ground,
revolution begins
in you, in me, revolution!
once lost
lost in their game
mental chains breaking now
set yourself free
who are they to tell you what to do?
the stage is not set, the road is not chosen
your fate not preordained
they are losing control, every step of the way
never too late to stand your ground,
revolution begins
in you, in me, revolution!
you were born your brother's keeper
why can i see blood on your hands?
you became your brother's slayer
embrace again upon death
at the end of all this hatred lies even deeper hate
their darkness has defeated you
your lifeline running backwards
remember, sins of our fathers
a requiem, for the countless dead
blood is on your hands
the wages of sin
future's eyes closing now
soul eclipse taking place
laments rise, tears of the dead
from the other side of the grave
you were born your brothers keeper
why can i see blood on your hands?
their darkness has defeated you
your lifeline running backwards
remember, sins of our fathers
a requiem, for the countless dead
blood is on your hands

we walk through the ages
the world on our shoulders
the burden we carry
to the dark end of our days
a thousand eyes watching
every step we are taking
waiting to see us
struggle and fall
and when we are beaten
the cross holds us down
i hear them laughing
and walking away
carry the cross
and suffer the loss
hear my confession
forever damnation
reincarnation
bleeding forever
recover the pain
pain gives me strength
pick up the cross
and carry it on
over and over
the wheel turns again
and when we are beaten
the cross holds us down
ihear them laughing
and walking away
carry the cross
and suffer the loss
hermy confession
forever damnation
sudden implosion of silenced emotions
buried beneath a scarred heart for too long
delusions of hope fading away
dying like leaves on frozen soil
my apocalypse is near
i can feel the end, coming here
neglecting existence repulse and repent
an endless journey into the morbid
whispering voices distorting all senses
buried beneath a scarred heart for too long
my apocalypse is near
i can feel the end coming here
my apocalypse is near
i can feel the end coming here
the bitter taste of a dying dream
shine the light on our shadows and illusions
the human race
like a chromatic stain
lost in concrete fields
hybrids of steel
mechanic god creation
enter annihilation
we are rendered obselete
just a relic at their feet
not cold enough  too human
the doomsday machine
created by man
like a black dawn rising
to conquer  conquer and destroy

never giving anything back
bridges that i thought i crossed
got to cross them all again
these parts that lead to nowhere
mocked me all my life
make a change
break the chain
make a change
end this game
vengeance in my eyes
a new power flows in me
on a journey ill
my mind floats astray
over withered fields
i cross the river
this shortness of breath
between birth and grave
fading in the distance
i am nothing
watch the skeleton dance
dancing on my grave
my frozen hour of death
watch the skeleton dance
on my grave
my frozen hour of death
here i am alone
casting my own shadows
traversing the mundane
desperate cry
boundless darkness
a voiceless fear
unheard, unseen
it is coming near
watch the skeleton dance
dancing on my grave
my frozen hour of death
watch the skeleton dance
here i am  alone
had i not known
that i was dead
i would have mourned
my loss of life
loss of life
watch the skeleton dance
dancing on my grave
my frozen hour of death
watch the skeleton dance
on my grave
my frozen hour of death
between birth and grave
here i am alone
i am after you
a shadow on the hunt
don't turn around
i am right behind you
i will get to you
and take you down
tear your insides out
crush your soul
i am out for blood
out for your blood
i am harder than steel
break your will
waiting all my life
to kill
i will get to you
and take you down
tear your insides out
crush your soul
i am out for blood
out for your blood
i can smell your flesh
i can taste your sweat
i can sense your fear
i am right here
i am out for blood
out for your blood
out for blood, out for blood
out for blood
out for blood, out for blood
out for blood
processed, diluted
virtually unrecognizable
i was lost there, no direction
a scattered void
no more
it's over
i'm on to you
your evil game
the tables have turned
i am taking back my soul
tranquilized, scrutinized
hate injected mind
as if internal wounds
wouldn't bleed, wouldn't hurt me
i see through your lies
taking back what's mine
your hate is our trigger
revolution now
the more we have to suffer
the more we will fight
with our fists
up in the air
legions marching
ready to fire
these streets will burn
let the black flag ride
legions marching
ready to fire
the fires of corruption
crash and fall
under black flags we march
the voice of rebellion
calls your name
servants of the truth
are standing tall
with our fists
up in the air
legions marching
ready to fire
these streets will burn
let the black flag ride
legions marching
ready to fire
the fires of corruption
crash and fall
legions marching
ready to fire
these streets will burn
let the black flag ride
legions marching
ready to fire
the fires of corruption
crash and
weak and sick i crawl
in the dust of past mistakes
leaving for the darkness
of tears and cold heartaches
suffer in this grief
of forever burning hate
the ashes of my life
by the torment you create
on my knees, remembering
the wasted years of dark insanity
the rage increases fast
as the memories eat me alive
god, i wish this to end
but i'm not prepared to die
no more a human being
just a fool of anxiety
unable to escape
the darkest insanity
hideous crimes an' atrocities
the slaughter of millions beyond belief
those were dark times so different from now
the law of evil ruled our fatherland
i was but a pawn in their game
why should i feel any guilt?
still when i close, close my eyes
the words unfold, it all comes back
i can't defy it, can't deny it
i know it to be true
in my sleep they come to haunt me
they know it to be true
tears of the dead
we are all on the turning wheel of fate
a young man standing proud in uniform
i never stopped to hesitate
until it was far too late
i was but a pawn in their game
why should i feel any guilt?
still when i close, close my eyes
the words unfold, it all comes back
i can't defy it, can't deny it
i know it to be true
in my sleep they come to haunt me
they know it to be true
tears of the dead
my hands are soiled, covered in blood
stains that never wash away
their hollow eyes confronting me
judging me
now an old man at the end of my days
contemplating my life of sin
living is never simple, the road is hard
i had no say, just a puppet in a sick play
i was but a pawn in their game
why should i feel any guilt?
still when i close, close my eyes
the words unfold, it all comes back
i can't defy it, can't deny it
i know it to be true
in my sleep they come to haunt me
they know it to be true
tears of the dead

a millenarian failure the dark age has returned
waiting for a miracle to save the common herd

beware the beast of man
for he's the devil's pawn
alone among god's primates
he kills for sport, lust or greed
the sacred scrolls

shun him or become like him
shun him, the beast of man
let him not breed in great numbers
for he will make a dessert of his home and yours
shun him, drive him back into his jungle lair
for he is the harbinger of death

i spit in your face preachers and leaders
spewing false dogma

a nation of wolves hunting the sheep
their fangs in your flesh
so painful and deep
despise your heros
living a lie
despicable heros
fooling the blind
open your mind
puppets on strings, face on the ground
nothing more than a shallow farce
consume the young thoughtless ones
eat their brain, leave them blind
and then destroy

i spit in the face or your preachers and leaders
spewing false dogma to their believers
a nation of fools, nothing but sheep
their fangs in your flesh so painful and deep
anxiety prevails in the end
on deathrow awaiting my fate
sacrificed upon the altars of justice
part of the ritual of ultimate fear
determined men prepare to slay
executioners axe draws near
on my way to depart from life
lost all sense, as the gallows i will die
let the killing begin
let them end your life of sin
feel the torment within

let them end your life of sin
feel the torment within
as the beauty of death sets in
counting the days, the sleepless nights
wide awake in a state of lunacy
voices inside my head
haunting memories, punishing me
through a tunnel of madness
these endless catacombs
left to die in a pit of confusion
swept away by a wave of illusion

angelclaw  a queen of the night
she reigns from her throne of stone
bringer of evil, a destroyer of souls
do what thou wilt, lust is her excuse
she'll use you up, suck you dry
this beautiful creature makes you high
try to break the spell that is cast
bu she knows you all to well
angelclaw...
effigy of a god long forgotten
a sickening ritual
she raises the chalice of blood
the hunt starts again...
lyrics: michael amott
the more i see  the less i believe
the more i hear  the less i care
this world we've created
has left me cold
this world is sedated
dying in it's sleep
i feel nothing
seen it written on a thousand faces
the simple truth we fear
seen it happen in a thousand places
instinct brought us here
the more i see  the less i believe
the more i hear  the less i care
we used to be the chosen ones
second to none
look at what we've become
a pathetic excuse for life
i feel nothing
i can feel nothing
nothing at all
except for the pain
that hits me again
again
lead  christopher amott
lead harmony  michael and christopher amott
step inside the circle of fire
flames of desire enlighten the night
follow your instinct
burn and writhe in ecstacy
love will turn to hate
heat will turn to ice
there is nothing in between
the first deadly sin
ancient taboo takes control
the demoneve possesses your soul
riding high above the flames
you will step into hell
lead and slide solo  christopher amott
lyrics: angela gossow
this is killing us
fighting the truth a losing battle
we believe in nothing
just hatred for each other
tragic sinister serenade
twisted melodies shatters reality
dying hopes for a better day
fragile dreams that break away
no more no more this pain must end
we have chosen to suffer
believe in nothing but...
hatred is a vicious circle
betrayal is at hand
paralysed souls bleeding
begging for salvation
deeper and deeper the wounds we cut
the truth burning our flesh
silent wars to set us free
stigmata of a tragedy
no more no more this pain must end
lead  christopher amott
lead  michael amott
we have chosen to suffer
feeling nothing  but hate
it's eating us up from the inside
taking out feelings away
welcome to the circus
leave your brain outside
sit back  relax
as we feed you lies
spoon fed stimulation
glittering fashion fascination
you are lost in the game
media corruption
you'll be amused
by the things we do to you
but in the bitter end
the clown is you
end of the line
you sold your soul
for a better life
you're better off dead
you had one life
you had one shot
you blew it
and you knew it
the rot sets in
no self control
at the end of the line
you play the fool
you'll be amused
by the things we do to you
but in the bitter end
the clown is you
end of the line
you sold your soul
for a better life
you're better off dead
end of the line
you're better off dead
end of the line
you sold your soul
for a better life
you're better off dead
end of the line
you're better off dead
end of the line
like insects of the night, we are drawn into the light
feeding off the star glow energ, controlling our fate
bloodsucker selling hope to the hopeless
newborn messiah or the devil incarnate?
surrounded by a field of lost souls
these feeble minds  so easy to control
salvation
damnation
it's all the same to you
but does anyone really know
what the future holds in store
a day will come
when the sun will rise again
rays of black will shine
and together as one,
we will walk in the dark of the sun
say a prayer for the unborn child in the womb
the children are the heirs of this dogmatic chaos
is there a future in this claustrophobic tomb?
we can only rely upon ourselves, to save us
we are the resistance, our last line of defense
prepared to fight for our promised land
rebels at heart, they will hunt us to the ends of the earth
the chase is on, forever going on and on
behold the apocalypse
the end is closing in
did you ever really doubt
that we would pay for our sins...
the heavens will burn
no one can save us now
everything we once loved
shall perish in flames...
armageddon coming on
a black dawn slowly rising
the heat will slowly consume you
like a moth around a flame
out of this silent planet
a single sign of life appears
a man made machine
carrying an embryo of human life...
as i walk alone
paralyzed and frozen
weakened by the fact
it is the life that i have chosen
this is life that i believed in
sentences me without mercy
staring down the depths
of the mind once again
regret this way of living
retrospectives in the end
losing faith in heaven
now conform to hell
blindfolds of romance
this pain i can not bear
this is life that i believed in
sentences me without mercy
this is life that i believed in
sentences me without mercy
yeah
symbolical and mystical
between life and death we're torn
a constant struggle
like an apocrypha
nobody can be certain
a thousand days, spent in hell
the ultimate sacrifice
your voyage starts
with a question mark
but the distant future
will not tell
bury me an angel
set my black soul free!!
blackened chariots
bearing evil souls
ride the surface of burning holes
nocturnal... traveller
you represent the ruined spirit
symbolical and mystical
you shall be damned for all time
tear down the walls
wake up the world
ignorance is not bliss
so fed up with second best
our time is here and now
i am the enemy
i am the antidote
watch me closely
i will stand up, now
we will rise we will rise
rise above
we will rise we will rise
rise
stereotype fools
playing the game
nothing unique
they all look the same
in this sea of mediocrity
i can be anything
anything i want to be
i am the enemy
i am the antidote
watch me closely
i will stand up, now
we will rise we will rise
rise above
we will rise we will rise
rise
we will rise
we will rise we will rise
rise above
we will rise we will rise
rise
we will rise we will rise
rise, rise above
we will rise we will rise
rise

born with eyes
but they are not to see
living on your knees
choking on spiritual agony
follow the traces of blood
throughout the past centuries
you choose not to see
bow down and worship me at the alter of shame
you strive for perfection but you don't have the tools
human weakness embodied
fodder to fools
feeding the fear of life it self
over and over again
and you choose not to see
bow down and worship me at the alter of shame
so you're the saint and i'm the sinner?
you will never understand
you're the saint and i'm the sinner
no  you will never understand

there goes the siren that warns of the air raid
then comes the sound of the guns sending flak
out for the scramble we've got to get airborne
got to get up for the coming attack.
jump in the cockpit and start up the engines
remove all the wheelblocks there's no time to waste
gathering speed as we head down the runway
gotta get airborne before it's too late.
running, scrambling, flying
rolling, turning, diving, going in again
run, live to fly, fly to live, do or die
run, live to fly, fly to live. aces high.
move in to fire at the mainstream of bombers
let off a sharp burst and then turn away
roll over, spin round and come in behind them
move to their blindsides and firing again.
bandits at 8 o'clock move in behind us
ten me109's out of the sun
ascending and turning our spitfires to face them
heading straight for them i press down my guns
rolling, turning, diving
rolling, turning, diving, going in again
run, live to fly, fly to live, do or die
run, live to fly, fly to live, aces high.
i leave the anguish behind
scars are healing  i am set free
the chains of guilt are in the past
they no longer have a hold on me
dead bury their dead

the light is shining on me

i am forced to creep down the path
of my sad and senseless life
darkness surrounds me
at the end of the tunnel
there is no light
a blackened void, nothingness
lament of a mortal soul
who am i?
only dust in the blowing wind
am i dying?
my name dies slowly
echoes into eternal oblivion
replaced by others
easily forgotten
i hate my empty existence
a blackened void, nothingness
1st lead  christopher amott
2nd lead  michael amott
lament of a mortal soul
who am i?
only dust in the blowing wind
...i am dying!
from the womb, to the tomb
an eternal struggle for the holy truth
we are not the first, nor shall we be the last
we shall be followed by thousands more
study the scriptures  intensify the faith
the works of men much greater than you or i
from the cradle to the grave
thousands of immortal souls just waiting to be saved!
pilgrim man what are you searching for?
believe the tales when everything else fails
pilgrim man deep in your heart you know
your faith is already bought and sold
all my life i served the cross
always believing my god was a just one
i maimed for you i killed for you
but looking back at my life
i just don't know anymore
weaving a web  of lies and deceit
it's a dangerous game  we play
all this time  the pain eating us away
all this time  the memories refuse to fade
a rotting shell of dying trust
we share this hell at any cost
phases and stages
circles and cycles
and empty charade
this pointless masquerade
a dangerous game
a dangerous game  we play
web of lies
i can see it in your eyes
web of lies
you can see it in my eyes
it will never be the same
we have gone too far this time
our temple of false dreams
comes crashing down...
a rotting shell of dying trust
we shared this hell at any cost
on the fields of desolation
we are all alone
crying in each others arms
in fear of the unknown
feelings of uncertainty
we are all doomed
to live in solitude
and never ending gloom
on the fields of desolation
eternal life or termination
why don't you cover me
i need your sanctuary
this sea i'm drowning in
might be where the end begins
in times of grief and sadness
we're searching for the light
seek for a place of safety
seek for a place to hide
god turned his back on man
in divine resignation
torn between two believes
eternal life or termination?
as we drown in darkness
weak and depraved
on our final journey
too late to be saved
we've gone through places
where the cold wind blows
is this the end of it all
i don't know, i don't know
meet your maker
rising from the ashes
like a phoenix to the sky
so intense, so glorious...
uncontrollable desire
for our souls
the great lawgiver
so high and mighty
the immaculate deception
a taker of life
with unbridled aggression
striking down on the disbelievers
savage  messiah
take us higher
savage  messiah
take us now!
blessed in blood
we are reborn in hate
thousands of spirits cry
so intense, so glorious...
uncontrollable desire
for our souls
the great messiah
so high and mighty
fly with me on a starlit sky
i'll set you free... yes, it can be
a dream unchased is a life at waste
never let them conquer your pride
our love is warm here
like the image of a distant sun
this star will always shine
and never, ever fade away
fly on... silverwing
fly with me... stay free... silverwing
seeking truths in spirit skies
which one of you will guide me tonight?
the milky way tastes sour,
has heaven lost its power?
so let us set sail on this sea of dreams
the moon gets lost in the morning sun
just let the spinning wheel spin
and let your life begin
8
so now the bridges are burnt
a lesson learned?
promises broken
tender lies softly spoken
changes in you
changes in me
maybe it was never meant to be
it wasn't you
it wasn't me
we were far too close to see
this liquid vision of euphoria
living a life on borrowed time
paying the price of immortality
desperately avoiding our fate
lead me through the halls of tortured souls
alone, forlorn... human dignity dethroned
forevermore  a life never ending
time stands still as the immortals keep on breeding
the future is locked within us
all we need is the key
crying at the fountain of youth
eternal life is killing me
triumphant in chariots they ride
on this arena of the undead
another lap of honor for the...
vacant galleries
these gardens of angst
in which i stand
lost and confused
hungry for more
eager to cross
this river of tears
safe in this void
in which i live
free from despair
weaving a web
surrounding my soul
imprisoned distress
in a world of dying angels
trespassers on unknown domains
traumatic defeat
this time i'll burn
for one thousand years
bearing the truth
deep down inside
it dies with me
taste the pure salt
of misery
hell's ecstasy
feel destiny
breathe in your neck
cut you so deep
twisting my mind
living in sin
dying within
wicked and mean
sinister eyes
staring at me
crawling in the slame
dirt infested minds
always second best, leader of the rats
spreading their disease
hiding behind trivial cynicism
venomous tongues spitting forth lies
so quick to criticize the life of others
who are you to judge us?
on a higher plain
our art lives on forever
you are the scum beneath us
fighting your pathetic battle
anonymous animosity
dirt infested minds
you hide behind trivial cynicism
venomous tongues spitting forth lies
so quick to criticize the life of others
who are you to judge us?
laughing right into your face
as we watch your infantile behavior
love us or hate us  we don't care
we never aimed to please you

running through my fingers
my life slipping away
and i feel nothing
swallow the tears
eat the pain  it's worth the degradation  eat the pain
behind the smile i feel nothing
i reach out to touch, but i'm not really there
this reflection in the mirror
can't reality be me
i see no connection
with who i wanted to be
drink another glass
swallow these pills
at the end of the rainbow
you take the bitter
the bitter with the sweet
when love dies
the angels cry
here i am
alone... alone in a crowd
spiritual isolation  the ultimate frustration
scratch the surface, tuurn another page
the ugly truth or another pretty lie
you deceived me, i believed you
why did everything go...
so wrong...
for so long...
so the truth comes out at last
i'm dead inside
i'm burning up
a hollow shell
my private hell
in my own misery
you leave me to dwell
then we were young and strong
now everything is wrong
did you want me, did you need me
could you not say you believed me?
everything we had is gone...
like an old forgotten song
the deceiver and believer
now everything is...
into the night, the darkest corner of my mind
sink into my inner self, an erotic fantasy
a spiraling vortex, an instant alter ego fix
here i am the ruler of all, in this kingdom of sin
sinister mephisto
ride the sky
sinister mephisto
the ultimate high
what i can't have in actuality
i feast upon in my reality
an extravaganza of forbidden pleasures
no sexual wish dark enough to suppress
i am no longer a mortal man
as master of the ceremony, divine perversion
i hereby declare the orgy to begin
ravage your luscious virgin flesh, how i love it
my cup runneth over, drink my distilled insanity

trapped in a downward spiral of pain
horrific memories, your life flashing by
there is no life left for you to live
you've had your share and more
act of transfusion, blood child!
transmigrate into the future or the past
eternal damnation awaits you my love
in the kingdom of the sick and the rotting dead
you will suffer excruciating pain
you shall now reap the twisted fruit
of what you once sowed
transparent, revealing the lies
transmutation, what you have become

transmigration macabre

the shape of all my doubts... my fear
come closer... trust me
here i stand in the falling rain
there is no joy inside these tears
i see the world through a twisted and bitter stare
to be where i have been... to see what i have seen
is it a dream?
or can i believe...
the memories will haunt me for evermore
the shape of all my doubts... my fear
come closer... i trusted you
i am not the man you used to know
why i am different... why everything is different now
when you left me, you planted a seed of hate in me
nothing is stronger... stronger than this

you will see
exist to exit

flashbacks from my past

images of you
leading my soul astray

your worst enemy dwells
from within
lyrics: angela gossow
this is the age of dehumanization
perverted creation
damned, misled children
you never stood a chance
resurrecting a dead messiah
for a paralysed race
damned, misled children
you never stood a chance
infected
neglected
the new breed of a generation to come
rejected
illfated
the new breed  a generation to kill
sowing the seed of suffering
upon these fertile hearts
damned, misled children
you never stood a chance
chosen to be slaughtered
by the masters of manipulation
dmaned, misled children
you never stood a chance
you can't kill me. i am living inside you.
i am a part of your existence
twisted thoughts in a twisted mind
provoking you
black is my heart  dark is my soul
my hatred i can not control
evil seed growing stronger
your freewill... dying!
inside you  heart of darkness
a part of you  heart of darkness
to deny me, is to deny yourself.
the illusion is dissolved
you are no longer in control
the facade crumbles  the transition is complete
...the transition is complete
i come to you in the night
i am your dark subconscience
i keep you awake, knowing
i am the heart of darkness
behold the apocalypse
the end is closing in
did you ever really doubt
that we would pay for our sins
the heavens will burn
no one can save us now
everything we once loved
shall perish in flames
armageddon coming on
a black dawn slowly rising
the heat will slowly consume you
like a moth around a flame
out of this silent planet
a single sign of life appears
a man made machine
carrying an embryo of human life
look out, here's starbreaker
cruisin' into town
set his mind to stealin'
every little heart around
step out on the sidewalks
if you're feeling game
he comes but once a lifetime
never seen again
starbreaker
glides in from the sky
starbreaker
takes you up so high
paradise is waiting
for the chosen few
let's hope maybe this time
he picks me and you
star voyage to a new world
lightyear miles away
cross your fingers, here he is,
take us now this day
starbreaker
glides in from the sky
starbreaker
takes you up so high
starbreaker, take my hand
starbreaker, understand
starbreaker, you're the one
starbreaker, lead us on, and on
look out, here's starbreaker
cruisin' into town
set his mind to stealin'
every little heart around
step out on the sidewalks
if you're feeling game
he comes but once a lifetime
never ever seen again
starbreaker
glides in from the sky
starbreaker
takes you up so high
i won't live to see tomorrow
there won't be another breath
none of them will ever sorrow
those who sentenced me to death
i've been waiting here for ages
for the hangman to appear
soon the priest will read some pages
from the bible for my fear
i see a place an evil place
comin' my way
what can i do where can i run
i'm gonna die anyway
things are getting clearer
this is the price i have to pay
i feel like screaming out my anger
there is so much left here to do
when it happened i was younger
and my destiny was you
i see a place an evil place...
what can i do about leaving you
we were only halfway through
what can i say
there was no other way
they wouldn't let me stay
standing at the bridge of destiny
so long since i tasted fear
lurking in the darkest holes
awaiting my mind's weakest moment
old words from an old world
against the laws of nature
they say the truth is overrated
wall of anger corrupt my thought
standing at the bridge of destiny
show me a sign
on the verge of losing my sanity
free my soul
my inner demons torture me
flapping their wings in my face
damn you! you twisted illusion
i am no longer afraid
see through their liquid souls
evil eyes that will hypnotize
you can no longer hurt me
i am my own worst enemy
standing at the bridge of destiny
show me a sign
on the verge of losing my sanity
free my soul
unleash the trapped souls of the dead
voices long forgotten
guardians of the lost faith
destined for glory
watch them all turn into sand
and the wind blow them away
wisdom pours into my soul
endlessly
standing at the bridge of destiny
show me a sign
on the verge of losing my sanity
free my soul yea
instrumental
at the mercy of our conscience
confined within our fate
never really questioned why
we are refugees in a dying world
to become a part of the end
are we the ones, the ones to blame?
we are mortals of shadows and dust
the sun sets on our sinking ship of fools
on our journey into oblivion
we ask ourselves again and again
now will we be remembered
the human blood is far too thin
the life in it much too fragile
dna code twisted into form
an ancient dream will now be reborn
demonic! science!
a high price for a passion so intense
demonic! science!
this world no longer makes any sense
save the best  strip away the rest
every weakness, every bleakness will be erased
new flesh for a new world!
men in white clothes performing the ultimate test
this is the era  this is the time
a new dawn arrives...
dark shadows from above
ravens fly, obliterate the sun
"it's a sign of the devil.
he will come for his servant tonight"
these are dark times
suspicious minds breed like rats
guardians of corrupt morality
spread their filthy lies
am i to burn
i have not sinned!
burnt at the stake.
innocent blood that can never be washed clean
the flames of ignorance
grow higher and higher
licking my flesh  burning my soul
the raven laughing in the moon
these are dark times
suspicious minds breed like rats.
guardians of corrupt morality
spread their filthy lies again...
liar, liar
conceal the truth
silver tongue
with a serpent's smile
bigot, betrayer
master of deceit
with your own interest at heart
when it all came to light
innocence was lost
how do you sleep at night?
lost trust, turned to dust
did not apply to you
an intricate web of lies
as the wheels kept on turning
no more thorns in my flesh
no more chains hold me down
i control my destiny
liar, liar
conceal the truth
silver tongue

bigot, betrayer

lost trust, turned to dust
no more thorns in my flesh
no more chains hold me down

no more thorns in my flesh
no more chains hold me down
i control my destiny
gripping you start to believe
all danger trust
in the end there is no relief
falling

from the ashes of a corrupt undying world
they raise like a phoenix
a godless entity
they are the khaos legions

back to the wall
i picked a fight
against the time
free at last

i will resist them
to the day i die
i am who i am
my time has come

take it or leave it
a rebel at heart
no gods, no masters

from a distance, the truth is so obvious,
answers are all so clear.
logic stays at arm's length
when engulfed in the present, here.
desperation draws near
if i could pull the fabric of time
and bring the future near,
the answers wouldn't be so far
the truth would be so clear.
time is black
and nothing will escape.
nothing will remain.
nothing.
from a distance time is black,
tangible and dense.
with each rotation a new day passed
and past, at last, makes sense.
there where past obstacles seem
just pebbles on your path
always just a step ahead
the peace i hope to catch
you choose your path.
don't shift the blame.
you ran your course.
you lost sight of your aim.
wrong choices linger,
like scars remain
long after the bleeding stops.
there's nowhere left to hide from the shame.
never again.
no! no more regrets.
what's done is done, can't be erased.
know your regrets, savour the bitter aftertaste.
the crippling guilt, how heavy it can be
when searching for the right words
hoping the truth will bring you peace.
a lesson learned is good company
for the lonely road you walk
each step forward, agony.
treat me like a prisoner
treat me like a fool
treat me like a loser
use me as a tool
face me 'til i'm hungry
push me in the cold
treat me like a criminal
just a shadow on the wall
shadow on the wall x4
like a shadow on the wall
treat me like i'm evil
freeze me 'til i'm cold
beat me 'til i'm feeble
grab me 'til i'm old
fry me 'til i'm tired
push me 'til i fall
treat me like a criminal
just a shadow on the wall
shadow on the wall x4
like a shadow on the wall
a fistful of fear in my hands
a bullet of betrayal in my brain
no progress comes from pleasure
we smile in ignorance and learn in pain
willful deceit was your plan
desperately avoid the blame
who will you answer to now?
sharpened your shovels
just to dig your grave
stand up because the ground is in your way
i won't give you any piece
yet still you talk
try to fight but i will watch you fall
fall
this is sweet revenge
and karma's a bitch
you glutton for punishment
what did you expect?
sick, sick, sick
i'm sick of being your martyr
your inglated ego is just dead weight
bask in all the eyes upon you
before you know it
the'll have turned away
stand up as the whole world turns away
i won't give you any peace
yet still you talk
try to fight but i will watch you fall
fall
this is sweet revenge
and karma's a bitch
you glutton for punishment
what did you expect?
wait and see
cry yourself a lonesome creek
your decaying corpse
can feed the roots
of my towering free
just wait and see
you're dead to me
yet still you speak
trying to justify what you're doing to me
i will watch you fall
fall
this is sweet revenge
and karma's a bitch
you glutton for punishment
what did you
what did you expect?
everything so clear now
it's written on your face
in a world within a world
i can smell the bridges burn
sharks ever circling
they never go away
in these dark, murky waters
so hard to navigate and so easy to hate
paint me black, demonize me, this is how you pay me back?
do you ever really know someone until you look away?
misplaced my trust, only to learn, honesty is just a word
this is a stolen life
before you walk away
don't forget to turn the knife
what's next, more betrayal?
have i not suffered enough?
you made me feel so alive
now you're just killing me killing me

as the candle sputters out
just beyond the abb and flow
of a dark and restless heart

friend or foe there's no way to know
in the battlefield of life its kill or be killed.
so many times its a matter of degrees
from being up on your luck to down on your knees.
its a hellish inferno
this is war eternal.
they try to change you, crush and break you.
try to tell you what to do
they love to have control of you
back against the wall
in danger of losing it all
search deep inside
remember who you are.
it's time like these when lines are drawn
which side of the fence you are standing on?
there will come a day not so far away
when the hunter becomes the prey and you will pay.
its a hellish inferno
this is war eternal.
they try to change you, crush and break you.
try to tell you what to do
they love to have control of you
back against the wall
in danger of losing it all
search deep inside
remember who you are.
this is fucking war!
they try to change you, crush and break you.
try to tell you what to do
they love to have control of you
back against the wall
in danger of losing it all
search deep inside
remember who you are.
we walk through war in the halls
of dead protocols
we came so close, demands were met
that's when the rug was ripped out from under our feet
a vicious crime, cold betrayal and deceit.
then reality hits you like a stab in the back
like a slap in the face, a premeditated attack.
on and on
the battle knows no victory
on and on
weapons high, reject defeat.
decrepit smiles shine like fire
lying through their teeth.
it's a memory you want to forget
from one second to another the whole world went under.
the future cuts so deep tangibility bleeds.
on and on! until the victory is dead and gone.
on and on! kill the history, the wrong side won!
don't let the history repeat

and i know it's good, i'm not evil
just misunderstood
do you see me now?

secrets can't be unlearned
silence can't be unheard... knowledge is burden
power is onus as the pages burn
rejecting cognition as the pages turn
sinking in a pool of either
the past is washed clean
rip apart the world
word by word
inch by inch
sever your timeline
silence your conscience
sweet amnesia here to free you
as the pages burn burn!
all you trials solved bye fire
as the pages burn
as smoke fills the room soon to pass... heavy gloom
the wind will whisk away the past
a blank page stares at you
nothing left
where to start?
a second chance carries expectation!
the books you'd written no longer exist
the future is in your pen
ink to paper now begin
rip apart the world

all you trials solved bye fire

let the flames eat your doubts

in the dark night, they defend their missiles
where it's the night we all die
enthralling power, who searches to be masters
they play their game with your life
the burning fire comes around, the heat is on
just for this day, it's all sad blues
the east sun is burning hard
see, your life is short
see the rainbow in the mirror
see the rainbow in the sky
see the desert in front of you
see the desert of life
standing in the cold rain, waiting for the end
see the shadows of the night
i have told you, but now it is too late
these are symphonies of doom
feel the danger, this final battle
it will imply us all god's agony
the endless blitzes just blind your eyes shut
and blow your life out to nothingness
black shadows storming in the east, but you can't see
the liec has set that power free
the east sun is burning hard
see, the life is short
see the rainbow in the mirror
see the rainbow in the sky
see the desert in front of you
see the desert of life
i'm no sinner, i'm no fool
i have heard these chants before
i have told you but now it is too late
these are symphonies of doom

now you all know
the bards and their songs
when hours have gone by
i'll close my eyes
in a world far away
we may meet again
but now hear my song
about the dawn of the night
let's sing the bards' song
tomorrow will take us away
far from home
no one will ever know our names
but the bards' songs will remain
tomorrow will take it away
the fear of today
it will be gone
due to our magic songs
there's only one song
left in my mind
tales of a brave man
who lived far from here
now the bard songs are over
and it's time to leave
no one should ask you for the name
of the one
who tells the story
tomorrow will take us away
far from home
no one will ever know our names
but the bards' songs will remain
tomorrow all will be known
and you're not alone
so don't be afraid
in the dark and cold
'cause the bards' songs will remain
they all will remain
in 1945 the year it came to be
their fate decided
many miles across the sea
they told them not to fear
they couldn't be prepared.
then came the day
that not a single soul was spared.
too late there's no escape
the trial has begun
down they fly
from out of the sky
feel the radiation burn!
the men of power
had nothing to fear.
when the finger hits the switch
they're far away from here.
down in their sanctuary
hiding in their lair.
the sorcerers of justice
will be waiting for them there.
too late there's no escape
the trial has begun
down they fly
from out of the sky
feel the radiation burn!
i saw the people running
through all my dreams.
i heard the soldiers crying,
mother nature screams.
i saw destruction falling
from out of the sky.
i heard the wise man calling
why?
in 1945 the year it came to be
their fate decided
many miles across the sea

inquisition takes its course
king philipp's armed force
templars are blamed for conjuration
they are said to be heretics
and coursed by the catholics

make your confession

in deserts i was preaching
the hand of god was with me
baptized with water and i praised
the one who came behind me
to save us all with the holy ghost
a prophet of the fools i've been lost
i'm sure you're there wandering around
but do you care for me
i'm alone
you talk of love not for me
in my dungeon cold i could think about
all the things you've said
but i can't understand you famous son
i left the way of heaven
or did you lead me from it
no no turning back
i'm banished from sanctuary
the darkness in me is filling me with pain
there's no way to turn back for eternity
in shadows i'm walking
and caught in loneliness
deliverance i wait for but how long?
are you the one who should come
show me the light in you
or should we wait for someone?
another!
no no turning back
i'm banished from sanctuary
the darkness in me is filling me with pain
there's no way to turn back for eternity
your reich should come to this world
your way smoothed by my blood, friend
my might will decrease but you'll get
high, yes so much higher
be careful of the rats, friend
cause they'll never sleep
before they catch you, too
the blind can see the sun
cripples walk alone
the deaf can hear my words
they believe just believe
they believe in me
look! the signs are near
to perform my task
to perform my way
to perform the way i walked
the way of the crucifix
i hear the hangman coming
i wait for execution
3:33
every night i hear thunder.
the shadow, can't you see?
so one night i will follow.
the dark side reigns in me.
he leads me to the dark plains.
the end is near, i feel.
but i've never seen his damned face.
my hearts pound hard in fear.
dead of the night, take me away.
dead of the night, he's looking for you.
a hundred solemn faces,
they look at me and laugh.
but if one wants to touch them,
they glow through nothingness.
if i come to tell you,
you look at me and laugh.
i never found the doctor,
so one day i'll be mad.
in that night i follow.
no pain, no work, no more.
he leads me on through the dark realm.
my sense grows far too dense.
guitar solo
dead of the night, take me away.
dead of the night, he's looking for you.
they will not take me easy.
no love will come through death.
i take them on and kill myself.
and just feel emptiness.
now you see them rising,
but no one knows but me.
so, don't try to follow a demon
and wait for a last attack.
in that night i follow.
no pain, no work, no more.
he leads me on through the dark realm.
my sense grows far too dense.
dead of the night, take me away.
dead of the night, he's looking for you.
dead of the night.

it cannot be seen
but there's blood on the green
only god knows i'm innocent
take me, take me home
a dark seed reigns in me
like the storm rules over the sea
i challenge thee, do not cross this bridge alone
don't dare me now
the threatening shadows will pass by
there're getting closer now
open your eyes
wake up my dear young friend
and hate shall fade away
i will not move, yet
i'll stand still, instead
there on the battlefield he stands
down on the battlefield he's lost
and on the battlefield it ends
war and anger shall reign
the clash of iron can be heard
by blindness you're driven insane
i'm lost in anguish and grief
sorrow won't wane 'til you die
a shattered body deeply hurt
and darkness will cover the light
it's gone forevermore
the field's been left in sorrow
the father and the son
they're gone
the sun shines bright
and anger rises
lorn and lonely
torn apart
don't you think
it's time to stop now
we were charmed and fooled by the old serpent's kiss
let's pray
that heaven is on our side
through violence and horror
shall honour arise
so let's pray
and blessed shall be our leader
we follow the noble and bright
don't you hear me crying
crying
come take me away
i hallow thy name
there on the battlefield he stands
down on the battlefield he's lost
and on the battlefield it ends
war and anger shall reign
the clash of iron can be heard
by blindness you're driven insane
i'm lost in anguish and grief
sorrow won't wane 'til you die
a shattered body deeply hurt
and darkness will cover the light
it's gone forevermore
that's what minstrel sing
join in the horrible screams
take part in murderous deeds
renowned be the lionhearted
join in the minstrelsy
wailing in endless grief
it eagerly longs for more
broken bodies lay down on the ground
blood sheds all over the place
the green will be stained forever
and hate reigns all over the field
they keep struggling on in anger
fiercely intense
outrageous, too blind to see
and in pain they keep on singing
we claim the land for the highlord
god bless the land and our highlord
war and anger shall reign
the clash of iron can be heard
by blindness you're driven insane
i'm lost in anguish and grief
sorrow won't wane 'til you die
a shattered body deeply hurt
and darkness will cover the light
it's gone forevermore

lei non c'e'
ed il buio arriva,
io so che non tornera'.
della magia tutto cio' che rimane
e' un ricordo nel tempo che va.
come un'alba la vita puo'
coprire ogni bugia,
verita' nascoste tra le ombre,
sogni pieni di follia.
presto sara' notte
nel buio che rimane.
poi di colpo tutto e' chiaro
e la luce ritorna da me.
lei ha chiuso gli occhi,
ha chiamato il mio nome,
non e' mai piu' tornata da me.
frutto del buio
il tuo seme cresce
in un mondo di malinconia
quando la luce
esce fuori dal cuore
lei non c'e'
resta il buio dentro,
nulla cura il mio male.
l'alba e' sparita
soffocata nel sogno
in un giorno che muore di gia'.
la speranza si spegne gia',
l'alba della vita.
di fronte alla morte
io sono rimasto solo.
frutto del buio
il tuo seme cresce
in un mondo di malinconia
quando la luce
esce fuori dal cuore

don't break the circle
unexplained, many things we thought were lost may come to light
on a higher plain in the spirit world
where only a few of us possess the second sight
now the messenger awaits
the chain is stronger if the lifeline is unbroken
so beware the presence of 'the unexpected guest'
don't break the circle
don't break the circle
don't break the circle
don't break the circle must keep going on and on
but wait, is there one amongst us here who disbelieves?
a stranger to the sign take care
for all the things you fear may be revealed
within the forces of the night
the chain is stronger if the lifeline is unbroken
so beware the presence of 'the unexpected guest'
don't break the circle
don't break the circle
don't break the circle
don't break the circle
don't break the circle
don't break the circle
don't break the circle
don't break the circle
the circle must keep going on and on
yes the circle must keep going on and on
don't break

when the sky is burning,
see the moon falling down.
on your right is lightning.
see the war in the sky.
remember brian,
when it's time.
remember brian.
guitar solo
all our empty heads
discover the war in the sky.
don't need no revolution
by the birthday of brian.
remember brian,
when it's time.
remember brian.
when the end is nearing,
see him hanging on the cross.
a war in the sky
now by the ending of brian.
remember brian,
when it's time.
remember brian.
she is gone
leaves are falling down
the tear maiden will not return
the seal of oblivion is broken
and a pure love's been turned into sin
at the dawn of our living time
hope may cover all cries
truth lurks hidden in the shadows
dreams might be filled with lies
soon there will be light
pain remains inside
suddenly it seemed so clear
all the blindness was taken away
she closed her eyes
and she called out my name
she was never ever seen again
harvest of sorrow
your seed is grown
in a frozen world full of cries
when the ray of life shrinks
shall cold winter nights begin
she is gone
and i fall from grace
no healing charm covers my wounds
fooled's the dawn
and so am i
fooled by life and a bitter doom
to bring you the end of the day
at the dawn of our living time
hope it soon will pass by
facing a darkness
i stand alone
harvest of sorrow
your seed is grown
in a frozen world full of cries
when the ray of life shrinks
shall cold winter nights begin
i cannot say that i don't care
'cause i'm aware of everyone and everything
they're everywhere
don't be a fool
stop spinning around
spinning around
you're right it ain't safe here
start using your brain
your brain
the cautious hare
cannot be seen as a coward
he's simply aware
he constantly knows what's going on
that the wheel of life turns on
it won't hold on
silent creature
filthy teacher's
spreading the disease
a release
a vanished
kingdom falls
it goes on
on and on
and again
it goes on
round and round
oh i can't get it out of my head
wish i'd be a bird of prey
a pure and a blessed
a hawk who could ease the pain
don't look back tell me
is it where you belong
a place in the dark
a song without hope
don't look back tell me
is it where you belong
oh i wait for an answer
so far
don't look back tell me
is it where you belong
i will wait for an answer
so far
don't look back tell me
is it where you belong
i will wait yes i will wait
don't look back
we're the last descendants
in the line of valiant soldiers
we're mistreated angels
we are the blackbird nation
we're the chosen ones
we're the last descendants
we're a tribe of unsung glory
we are the fallen angels
well the time is right
you shall be on my side
i don't i don't i don't need anyone
be with or be against me
i'm white i am chosen
there is not the slightest
doubt it all
not at all
in lower airs
we're ground down
by their ignorance
hate will grow like a foul cancer
to find a foe seems to be the answer
round and round
oh i can't get it out of my head
wish i'd be a bird of prey
a pure and a blessed
a hawk who could ease the pain
don't look back tell me
is it where you belong
a place in the dark
a song without hope
don't look back tell me
is it where you belong
oh i wait for an answer
so far
don't look back tell me
is it where you belong
i will wait for an answer
so far
don't look back tell me
is it where you belong
i will wait yes i will wait
don't look back
don't be a fool
stop spinning around
spinning around
don't move it ain't safe here
they've stained holy grounds
oh no
the hopeful he sadly admits
there's no hero no place to hide
there is no shelter from the storm
the maddened crow will spread terror
but i know
bitterly they will stumble
find themselves smashed on the ground
don't look back tell me
is it where you belong
a place in the dark
a song without hope
don't look back tell me
is it where you belong
oh i wait for an answer
so far
don't look back tell me
is it where you belong
i will wait for an answer
so far
don't look back tell me
is it where you belong
i will wait yes i will wait
don't look back
it's you who has said
there's no tomorrow
i don't know but who i am
i wouldn't sit back any longer
it's surely built in sadness
but the sadness surely will go by
so we will all know the answer
the answer's within
it's in your mind
4:36
instrumental
run 'til you find the answer
time out for our poor cassandra
she's fairy safe inside the fire
inside the fire
awakes desire
cruelly admired
they'll torture her soul
and they'll torment her heart
but won't change her mind
would you like to see me
how i'll cut off
her head life's a game
a lesson to learn
don't be shy just blame me
well, there is no need to feel ashamed
remember the oath
remember the oath
wake up it's time to cross the border
is it true what they say
about the part you've played?
enjoy your stay here
welcome to the slaughterhouse
release from rotten thoughts
no more pain
and no more gods
under the ice you will believe
under the ice you will be free
released from rotten thoughts
no more pain
and no more gods
please understand
it's not in our hands
barren the land
it's all dead and gone
and still the tyrant's face is red
so witness my glory, my triumph, my fame
it's the sweetest taste
king of terror
just stop wining
hold your breath
it won't take long realize
this is your judgement day
in between the killing carry on
there are no rules here
welcome to the slaughterhouse
release from rotten thoughts
no more pain
and no more gods
under the ice you will believe
under the ice you will be free
released from rotten thoughts
no more pain
and no more gods
try to understand
you're the artificial enemy
an illusion we all need
for our sake
for our sake
we're not allowed to see
beyond that's your skill
will we ever learn the lesson
"we can't fly with broken wings"
break the chains
time to change
i'm afraid to say
but you won't play a part
it's been nice we now get to the climax
your destination's unknown
just get out of my way
don't mind the blood here
welcome to the slaughterhouse
release from rotten thoughts
no more pain
and no more gods
under the ice you will believe
under the ice you will be free
released from rotten thoughts
no more pain
and no more gods
try to understand
under the ice you will be free
release from rotten thoughts
no more pain
and no more gods
and no more gods
i'm afraid to say
but you won't play a part
in fact it was close to a real fallout
everything's under control
the speaker said with a serious smile
behind his mask
he knew the truth
i'll bring a new age of better ways
the tv preacher said
just pay today
pay today
world's dressed in black
on earth's judgement day
and i?
i know it can't go on
forbidden signs increase
i'm sitting still at home
and watching
born in a mourning hall
pale clouds feared the unborn child
then it grew up with growing plans
of suicide
born in a mourning hall
shadows left the fear inside
that peter pan will never reach
the other side
it's frightening
exciting to sit at home
and watch the burning fields
get
hypnotized by the tv snake
obey and work hard
and feel no anger
just sympathy for the higher class
there's no chance in changing things
'cause i am
born in a mourning hall
silent cries ran out
when the cradle breaks
broken dreams were unheared on
the other side
born in a mourning hall
shadows left the fear
in the new born child
that peter pan will never reach
the other side
and i'm a part of the machine
a puppet on the strings
a rebel, once
now i'm an old man
oh, i know this can't go on
but the ghost called fear inside
lames my tongue, my nerves, my mind
eternal fall down
someone cut the strings off
i can't move
to get back courage
i've to face the truth
but not today
goodbye
born in a mourning hall
caught inside a web called life
the only way to get out soon
is suicide
born in a mourning hall
pale souls built a frozen world
infected brains
will never reach the other side
the other side
elle part sans se retourner
et l'automne feuille feuille s'coule
le sceau de l'oubli s'est bris
en souillant un innocent amour
l'aube de notre naissance
le monde semble d'esprance
les rves s'emplissent de chimres
la vrit se terre
mais la nuit son heure
apporte la douleur
en un instant, tout tait plus clair
lumineux, transparent comme l'air
elle ferma les yeux et m'appela d'un cri
personne jamais plus jamais ne la revit
moisson de peine, graine seme
dans une terre de larmes gele
le jour s'teint dj
dans l'hiver vient le froid, la nuit
elle part, et je perds tout espoir
rien ne pourra gurir mes blessures
insens comme l'aube
amer et malmen par le sort
de vouloir te mener bon port
l'aube de notre naissance
tourne le vent de la chance
face aux tnbres
je reste seul
moisson de peine, graine seme
dans une terre de larmes gele
le jour s'teint dj
dans l'hiver vient le froid, la nuit
it's warm and tender
but very soon it turn cold
shadows stare down from the walls
out of the mist
it's coming closer now
it never rains
it pours on me
so let the saints
set up the courtyard
the unpleasant cage
the obvious point is i'm insane
was i aware
whom i had slain
i fear i was the faceless
the nameless
the bush set on fire
no one ever dared to speak
"shame on me
i don't believe
the here and now
is all we're living for"
joyful it seems
but then suddenly
by one false move
it's blown away
joyful it seems
but then suddenly
their voices cease
it's gone away
vanished
to the point of no return
vanished
to the point of no return
witness my last breath
i do not regret
a word i've said
the strong will survive
the weak must die
and out of the mist
it's coming closer now
sinner and saints
the grateful slaves
nature's law instead of god in heaven
from far beyond
i can hear them sing
i hear angels sing
songs of innocence
i hear angels sing
despite the facts are clear
it cannot be
what we can't see
i must admit
it sounds so sweet
joyful it seems
but then suddenly
by one false move
it's blown away
joyful it seems
but then suddenly
their voices cease
it's gone away
vanished
to the point of no return
vanished
to the point of no return
angels sing i hear angels sing
can hear them sing
far beyond i hear them sing
"it's true, it's true
we don't exist"
far beyond i hear them sing
"it's true, it's true
we don't exist"
well we all know
there's no other side
it's good and evil
i know right between
there's no borderline
this is the punishment divine
surrounded by night
i've been offered insight
there is none but the sin of pride
am i wrong an i right
am i losing my sight
abandoning the superior mind
joyful it seems
but then suddenly
by one false move
it's blown away
joyful it seems
but then suddenly
their voices cease
it's gone away
vanished
to the point of no return
vanished
to the point of no return
right away i will be gone
gone i will be gone
through the valleys grey
through the shapeless land
i walk alone
i'm left alone
through the deepest void
a blackened paradise
i walk alone
i'm left alone
sammy was low,
just watching the show,
over and over again.
he knew it was time,
he'd made up his mind,
to leave his dead life behind.
his boss said to him
boy, you'd better begin
to get those crazy notions
right out of your head
sammy who do you think that you are?
you should have been sweeping,
at the emerald bar.
spread your wings and fly away,
fly away, far away.
spread your little wings and fly away
fly away, far away.
pull yourself together,
'cause you know you should do better,
that's because you're a free man.
he spends his evenings alone,
in his hotelroom.
keeping his thoughts to himself,
he'd be leaving soon.
wishing he was miles and miles away,
nothing in this world, nothing,
would make him stay.
since he was small,
had no luck at all,
nothing came easy to him.
now it was time,
he'd made up his mind,
this could be my last change
his boss said to him
now listen boy, you're always dreaming,
you got no real ambition,
you won't get worried for.
sammy, boy don't you know who you are?
why can't you be happy,
at the emerald bar?
so honey spread you wings and fly away,
fly away, far away.
spread your little wings and fly away,
fly away, far away.
pull yourself together,
'cause you know you should do better,
that's because your a free man.
come on honey fly with me...
high in the sky where eagles fly
morgray the dark enters the throne
open wide the gate, friend
the king will come
blow the horn and praise
the highest lord
who'll bring the dawn
he's the new god
in the palace of steel
persuade the fate of everyone
the chaos can begin
let it in

years ago i came back.
this'll be my hardest attack.
burning fire in my brain.
i can feel the deadly flame.
you'll never make it, your blood i suck.
your fire's burning round my neck.
celebration, let the day.
hunting me down, there's no escape.
there's no way out, but trying to escape.
you're just insane, can't catch me.
halloween, i'm sent to hear his voice on halloween.
halloween, can feel the kiss of death on halloween.
when you feel the kiss of death,
there's nothing you can do.
an angel sent me to destroy and kill.
yeah.
you see the x, but it's too late.
it's in your head and you are dead.
there's no way out, they tell us.
can feel the kiss of death.
there's nothing in my head but blood.
halloween, i'm sent to hear his voice on halloween.
halloween, can feel the kiss of death on halloween.
guitar solo
this gaining dawn i feel.
just tell me how this is real.
is it the end of me and you?
can feel the kiss of death.
there's nothing in my head but blood.
halloween, i'm sent to hear his voice on halloween.
halloween, can feel the kiss of death on halloween.
halloween, i'm sent to hear his voice on halloween.
cut off the light
take a look
there's nothing beyond but pain
suffer in the deepest void
the flame of hope isgone
what have i done?
denied the father and the sun
for a moment it seemed
there's space beyond the spheres
aflame the night
so clear and bright
unstable light
you've been sacrificed in fear
now there's one thing for sure
i'm not afraid anymore
day after day we've been fixed in the bowl
for so long
for ages we're captured in shells
and crystallized walls
predestined or punished?
by man or god?
i cannot, i will not
deny it's false innocence
i cannot, i will not
the age of false innocence
take it away from me
for a while
astronomy has moved the earth
and we've turned around the sun
sanctum officium
has made me believe
has made me believe
has made me believe
"we know for sure you're lying
would you like to mess with holy science
you know the fear of dying
would it be worth it to hear you crying"
i've slaughtered truth
and i've shattered my heart
far too long i have played with hellfire
and science has turned into madness
but i should have taken it higher
so i feel so i feel
like judas must have felt before
that wednesday night near by the tree
day after day we will gratefully suffer for more
predestined's our part
so we bleed in the name of god
don't believe in their eternity
we're still held in blindness
and i've been turned into a liar
if there is no heaven
there won't be release
i cannot, i will not
deny it's false innocence
i cannot, i will not
the age of false innocence
i cannot, i will not
deny it's false innocence
i cannot, i will not
the age of false innocence
take it away from me
ella se ir y las hojas caern
la doncella no regresar
el sello del olvido se ha roto
y ese amor puro ya no ser
amanece la vida la esperanza nos cobijar
la verdad est escondida en sombras
los sueos mentirn la noche ser y el dolor est
de repente todo se aclar
la ceguera tambin se alej
sus ojos cerr y mi nombre invoc
y ya nunca, nunca la volvieron a ver
cosechando el dolor ese amor creci
en un mundo lleno de opresin
cuando el rayo de luz
se oculte otra vez y la noche comience
ella se fue y yo pierdo la fe
mis heridas ya no cerrarn
es el alba engaado
y con l me engao yo tambin
y al final de ese da, volver
amanece en la vida, s que pronto todo pasar
y enfrento las sombras de pie en soledad
cosechando el dolor ese amor creci
en un mundo lleno de opresin.
cuando el rayo de luz
se oculte otra vez y la noche comience
ella parti
y el bosque durmi
la doncella nunca volver
el sello del olvido se ha roto
y en pecado un amor tornar
nuestra vida sola baila
esperanza gritos cubrir
la verdad en el pasado
sueos mentiras mostrarn
la noche vendr
dolor quedar
de repente todo se aclar
la venda de los ojos cay
sus ojos cerr
y mi nombre grit
ella nunca nunca mas fue vuelta
a ver
mies del dolor
tu fruto creci
en helada tierra de pesar
cuando muera la luz
la noche invernal
vendr
ella parti
y yo pierdo la fe
mis heridas no podrn sanar
traer al ocaso
pese a que ser burlado yo
por la vida y el juicio final
amanece en la vida y s
que pronto todo pasar
y enfrento las sombras de pie en soledad
mies del dolor
tu fruto creci
en helada tierra de pesar
cuando muera la luz

the giant's lost and all round him destructed for what
they all knew what it meant but they couldn't change it
lord they had gone too far, leave them alone
it's all gone, what is left behind
on a desert we called earth
when the last whale went away
did they ever see the tears
don't fear your last step from the theatre of pain
and the children will love your singing
from the sea, from the sea
the sea that is calling, now we've to leave it
the sea was clear on the day i was stranded
answers i'd known to keep this all alive
but i can't change it forever
now i'm gone
and it seems that life had never existed
so we left the dark and cold
all i left behind are my tears
don't fear your last step from the theatre of pain
and the children will love your singing
from the sea, from the sea
the sea that is calling, i hear them calling

no doubt doubt
no longer need to hide it
i've found out who i am
i' moved around in circles
i rise and fall again
i know it well
every word i tell
seems to make no sense at all
words will heal it
love will conquer
the hearts of the hopeless
the almighty is still alive
risin' up from the heart of the desert
risin' up for jerusalem
risin' up from the heart of the desert
building up old jerusalem
risin' up from the heart of the desert
risin' up for jerusalem
risin' up from the heart of the desert
building up old jerusalem
i've gone beyond
but there's no life
and there is nothing how it seems
i've gone beyond
but there's no life
there is no healing rain in eden
the empty barren wasted paradise
let's celebrate the dawning of the son
i turn to you oh my precious jerusalem
deny your prophets their passion and treat them like fools
i turn to you oh my precious jerusalem
deny my love but you can change fate
son of man
you truly are mine
can't stand the pain
no more grief and misery
it goes on and on and on and on
and on and on and on
father stop it now
we must stop it now
you really think you are half way up
i would not mind if you were right
it's not sure
i'd rather say you are half way down
so i am going to help you
if i can
i've been caught
in wilderness
in wilderness
i've got out well
i found myself
in desert lands
in desert lands
but you've been on my mind
i turn to you oh my precious jerusalem
deny your prophets their passion and treat them like fools
i turn to you oh my precious jerusalem
deny my love but you can change truth
rise up and follow me
'cause i will bring the light
rise up and follow me
wake up and clear your mind
i try to bring it back
the seed of life
i try to bring it back
the seal of light
so if you say
there's no faith in man
you better keep in mind
that i can read between the lines
my heavy burden brings
eyesight to the blind
i've been caught
in wilderness
in wilderness
i've got out well
i found myself
in desert lands
in desert lands
but you've been on my mind
i turn to you oh my precious jerusalem
deny your prophets their passion and treat them like fools
i turn to you oh my precious jerusalem
deny my love but you can change me
i'm not insane
that's how it seems though
spiteful cruel but wise
beyond his age
my body fails
my soul will rise
the end of life's immortalized disease and agony
and i see death through golden eyes
beyond the door
there's something more
it seems there's just one way
on through the heat
i've felt the touch of evil
i still feel the icy claw in me
for a decent price
i've banned kindness from my heart
the spirit of all truth and beauty
pawned for my desire
and from the flames
as chance would have it
the soulforged will come into light
and from the flames as chance would have it
the soulforged,
the stainless will rise
i will never change my mind
i will leave it all behind
and through the hour glass
everything's grey
everyone's pale
no colour nor beauty will enlighten my heart
the seat of life's empty and cold
cadaverous you all seem to me
stillborn but you're still alive
you're still alive
truth lies in loneliness
when hope is long gone by
i'll wipe out the bliss of the new age
and welcome you precious night
and from the flames
as chance would have it
the soulforged will come into light
and from the flames as chance would have it
the soulforged,
the stainless will rise
from a distant time
voices echo in the hall
"come and join us
enter life and everything is gone now"
and through the looking glass
i still fear mortality and its loss in the end
unlimited power in my hands
the claw of the dragon ascends
"mourn for his lost soul
he's cursed and condemned"
each step i take
may it hurt may it ache
leads me further
away from the past
but as long as i breathe
each smile in my bleak face
i'm on my way to find
back to the peace of mind
and from the flames
as chance would have it
the soulforged will come into light
and from the flames as chance would have it
the soulforged,
the stainless will rise
i will never change my mind
i will leave it all behind

i am a preacher with a message for my people
over the world, scratching on the ground
looking for the peace that nobody has found
i am a spokesman for a better way of living
love is the word and it can be heard
if you are young the message can be sung
guitar lead
let me hear you sing
hallelujah 3x
oh tell it to the man who's power is the sermon on the wall
tell it to the man who says you can misjudge them all
tell it 'till it can be heard above the wailing of the crowd
tell it on the field of war and hope you'll soon be justified
there is a better way of life and it's not so hard to find
if you live and let the people in your world
speak its mind
i am the pupil who sells his life for freedom
all over the world and it can be heard
if you are young the message can be sung
guitar lead
hallelujah 3x
a wooden cup
and a crown of thorns
will set up the stage for the cross
i rent a room next door
there is nothing more
no further voices to hear
i'll be free
it doesn't matter anymore
that someone's knocking at my door
i've known it long before
the galilean's on the floor
shame on me
shame on me
i'm a tool and nothing more
i can feel it's getting nearer
images they'll turn out clearer
creeps in and out of your mind
i'm destiny personified
i know there's something more behind
but is it really justified
to sacrifice
to crucify
the rescue of the human kind
sadly sings destiny
sadly sings destiny
"for ages i've been waiting
now spring is in the air
let it in"
repeat
i hear them howling hear them scream
the raging mob turns mad it seems
the king's in town
we need a crown
i think we all know
how it ends
so we're not going take it longer
so all i know is i don't care
sp we're not going take it longer
now we are aware
i can feel it's getting nearer
images they'll turn out clearer
creeps in and out of your mind
i'm destiny personified
i know there's something more behind
but is it really justified
to sacrifice
to crucify
the rescue of the human kind
sadly sings destiny
sadly sings destiny
"for ages i've been waiting
now spring is in the air
let it in"
repeat
there i tie the ass
there i tie the colt
begging for a last chance
i hear the voices say
"we get him home tonight
and that's all you need to know"
i'm alone
so i can't stand it any longer
and i don't want to see it all
nazarene your vision will come true
will come true
they'll get you
i can feel it's getting nearer
images they'll turn out clearer
creeps in and out of your mind
i'm destiny personified
i know there's something more behind
but is it really justified
to sacrifice
to crucify
the rescue of the human kind
sadly sings destiny
sadly sings destiny
"for ages i've been waiting
now spring is in the air
let it in"
repeat
nothing will grow here
icy fields  blackened sorrow
legacy of a lost mind
feed my void
what you're waiting for
i'm too late
it is more than a game
the river reveals
now i'm in between these lines
i cannot escape it seems
sail on, my friend
all i ever feel is
all i ever see is
walls they fall
when the march of the others begins
all i ever feel is
all i ever see is
rise and fall
when the war of the thrones shall begin
while i sit there in silence
come and talk to me
i can't free my mind
it is all i'm begging for
while i sit there in silence
will it ever end?
will i find what i'm longing for?
will i ever walk out of shadows so grey?
i'm condemned, i am hallowed
icy fields they won't hurt anymore
will you walk with me?
any further
there at world's end
it's me
i sing
i cannot escape it seems
sadly i sing
all i ever feel is
all i ever see is
walls they fall
when the march of the others begins
all i ever feel is
all i ever see is
rise and fall
when the war of the thrones shall begin
away
watch the river it flows
now and ever
i cannot believe in more
and now my time will come
carry on
will i ever learn from the past?
will i fade away?
will i ever stay where the shadows will grow?
there is luck at the gallows
i will free my mind
soon it will show
let it rain
there'll be no spring
my dream is a mirror
it reveals a matter of lies
all i ever feel is
all i ever see is
rise and fall
when the war of the thrones will begin
all i ever feel is
all i ever see is
rise and fall
when the war of the thrones has begun
leave a fee for the tillerman
and the river behind
for what i was
i'm doomed to be
the tempter and the secret foe
cause i am hell and hell is me
pure hate will grow
still i claim to be the chosen one and
still i claim
this is rebellion rising

the tenure of kings and their magistrates
by good men it must be deposed
the covenant made can be voided at once
disanoint him, take his crown
they plead for their king
and they pity their lord
put him to death, that's what i say
though never so just these dancing divines
endue him with reason and grace
they're gibberish
words dissemble the facts
god's will
they falsely will claim
let him curse my name
on these blood stained pages of misery
let him call me a tyrant so cruel
let him curse my name
but remember the truth
so there they come
from everywhere
they witness revenge
hear them calling
you're laden with blood
it's spilled everywhere
and sorrow's everlasting
oh you'll be aware now
that trial is near
it's close at hand
the masquerade is over
it ends
remove his crown
and bring him down
remove his crown
and bring him down
now we shall mourn no longer
our prayers they've been heard
now we shall mourn no longer
our prayers they've been heard
we won't take it anymore
that will bind us to the tyrant
we won't take it anymore
our voices shall be heard
we won't take it anymore
that will bind us to the tyrant
we won't take it anymore
our voices shall be heard
we won't take it anymore
and we're the one we are the nation
we won't take it anymore
and we're the one we are the law
we won't take it anymore
and we're the one we are the nation
we won't take it anymore
and we're the one we are the law
falsely they praise
deify his majesty
he's blessed annointed's
fulfilling god's will
curse them all
no further he's king
providence brought him straight into our hands
let him curse my name
on these blood stained pages of misery
let him call me a tyrant so cruel
let him curse my name
but remember the truth
now let him appear
there's joy in the air
now witness a new age is dawning
in trouble alone
he's facing despair
awaiting his bitter ending
we all know he's quilty as charged
by punishment due to his crime
we sacrifice the wicked king
aknowledged by scriptures and law
let him curse my name
on these blood stained pages of misery
let him call me a tyrant so cruel
let him curse my name
but remember the truth
on these blood stained pages of misery
let him call me a tyrant so cruel
let him curse my name
but remember the truth
we won't take it anymore
our voice it shall be heard
but i will remember the truth
we won't take it anymore
our voice it shall be heard
but i will remember the truth
the realm's bleeding
it suffers 
old and weak
no further arguing
there is war at hand
the system's failing
engine's running
then after all
i sense the end is dawning
these lunatics deny the truth
i know i will not fail
there'll be
war
it's now or never
we shall stand together
one by one
this world is sacred
i'm coming home
war
it's now or never
we shall stand together
one by one
this world is sacred
i'm coming home
coming home
you chase in twilight
and you know
you will be on your own
on your own
the misery shown
i'll be alone in this hour
i face the unknown
witness the end
i'm bleeding. i'm fading
here in my final hour
when long lost memories return
and a voice keeps calling
"all dead and gone
it's out of hand
life is in motion"
i'm wishing. i'm fading
"time to wake up
face the truth"
i'm sinking
i'm drowning
there's no doubt and no regret
"time to reveal now"
this is no illusion
it is real
carry on the flame
it's not over now
watch me, i will rise
time to reveal now
i know i will not fail
anymore
i'm the one forever
all that really matters
blessed realm
this world is sacred
i'm coming home
war
it's now or never
we shall stand together
one by one
this world is sacred
i'm coming home
yesterday's gone
there's no today, no tomorrow
i'm raised from the dead
the ritual failed
there at the gates
i'm left alone in this hour
driven insane
i am left alone
and now i drown in deepest shadows
while the golden hall is sealed
i'm wishing
i'm fading
and i'm part of the machine
my eyes are the eyes of a dead man
and feel the unholy stream
the source of my power
tenergy
i'm in control
i will live forever
all that really matters
blessed realm
this world is sacred
i'm coming home
war
it's now or never
we shall stand together
one by one
this world is sacred
i'm coming home
i spread my wings
but keep on falling
i should have known
i can see it coming
the war is over
there's whispering in the wind
just let me out of here
there is no way
there's no end
while all the suffering goes on
all that i know
is that i'm not insane
it's not over
now you all know the bards and their songs
when hours have gone by, i'll close my eyes
in a world far away we may meet again
but now hear my song about the dawn of the night
let's sing the bards' song
tomorrow will take us away far from home
no one will ever know our names but the bards' songs will remain
tomorrow will take it away the fear of today
it will be gone due to our magic songs
there's only one song left in my mind
tales of a brave man who lived far from here
now the bard songs are over and it's time to leave
no one should ask you for the name of the one
who tells the story
tomorrow will take us away far from home
no one will ever know our names but the bards' songs will remain
tomorrow all will be known and you're not alone
so don't be afraid in the dark and cold
'cause the bards' songs will remain they all will remain
i travel a dusty old road
and carry on ultimate terror
the torture will grow
while infinity's lost
the lunatic fears the unknown
into the fire
curse me
unknown
into the fire
everything is gone
did i miss the point
or fail to see
that i am lost
cause i'm chosen
crash another tower
grind the universe
i'll tear it into pieces
mourn forevermore
and here i...

my locked up asylum
don't turn your back
on your prodigal son
when terror is raging
still my hate will grow
here on my own
i've built a pyre
oh, fire
here on my own
i've wasted life
so weak
a dark sword
a black soul
my soulmate gets near

i'm banned from the island
refuse me, deny me
i'm pale and i'm weak

it's coming to an end
here's my last stand
the torture at last
will be gone with the past
infinity, where i'll go?
into the fire

in war
into the fire
everything is gone
it's your blood i desire
the last soul i require
right after all the damage will be done
and here i...
chorus
cry for tanelorn
still i fear the voices
cry for tanelorn
no more fear, no voices

yesterday's gone
there's no today nor tomorrow
i'd risk all the land
the ritual failed
there at the gates
i'm left alone in this hour
driven insane
i am left alone
and now i drown in deepest shadows
while the golden horn is sealed
i'm wishing
i'm fading
and i am part of the machine
no one lives forever
all that really matters
find the one
this world is sacred
i'm coming home
war it's now or never
we shall stand together
one by one
this world is sacred
i'm coming home
hoooooooooome!
now there is no end
the wheel will turn, my friend
i'm in flames
cause i have touched the light
it pulls me so
we shall be one
forevermore
that's all i want
it's all i need
everything is fixed
there's no chance
there's no choice
it's calling me
saidin
so precious and sweet
my mind keeps fading away
it's scratching deeper
my sole reliever
how can i find you now?
passing through the flames
i see
how terror will rise
it soon will be over
o father of lies
like foul winds at twilight
it's coming over me
what was and what will be?
what is?
i don't know
driving me insane
just feel the heat
madness creeps in
i'll tear it down
there's no end
wheel of time
it keeps on spinning
there's no beginning
turn the wheel of time
there's no beginning
just keep on spinning
light  it binds me
light  it blinds me
light  it finds me
light denies me now
i creep along
so desperate and tired
let me ask you
why?
i am what i am
prophecies i am the chosen
ta'veren
the flame will grow
feel the heat
i'll keep on breathing
after all there's no tomorrow
wheel of time
save my soul, find a way
and if i fail, will it all be over?
oh wheel of time
the vision
so fleeting and vague
once again i will bring down the mountain
one last glimpse
it is costantly slipping away
the young man said
"i will never give up"
the inner war
i can hold against it
my mind, my mind
my mind's in darkness
the young man says
"i will never give in"
the prophecy
behold it's true
i conquer the flame
to release the insane
i'm crying
i cannot erase
i'm the dragorn reborn
and in madness
i soon shall prevail
twice i'll be marked and
twice i shall live
the heron sets my path
and name me true
twice i'll be marked and
twice i shall die
my memory's gone
but twice i pay the price
wheel of time
save my soul
find a way
may it be as the pattern has chosen
oh, wheel of time
turn the wheel of time
it keeps on spinning
there's no beginning
there's no end, wheel of time
there's no beginning
just keep on spinning
shine on
embrace and deny me
turn on, wheel of time
shine on
you've burnt me, now guide me
weave on, wheel of time
dead girl:
please, sister, wake me up
you've traveled far
release my mind
sing this song of mine
save me from drowning
quick, cast your spell on me
i sense you're finally getting near
can you hear me crying?
i've got to break the silence
the lover:
i know they're out there
play hide and seek
watching
my love is wasted
the storyteller:
my worst dreams
i can't leave them
i'm the black queen
here in barren lands
the fox:
when you walk down
you may not find relief
will you go down there?
i wonder
wonder why
all:
here on this road of no release
pale reign of misery
that even time cannot erase
on through my sorrows
life will go on
dead girl:
words and dreams unite
i hear an ancient voice
it's calling for me
when death and life collide
i hear an ancient song
the resurrected girl:
deep inside
i can't find myself
can't remember at all
the past and my strange end
come guide me now
can't remember my fall
there's something
there's someone
it ain't over now
the void  there's more to it
it's real and still alive
the necromancer:
i will find you
slipping away
i'll bind you
still i conquer the world
take him away
all:
here on this road of no release
pale reign of misery
that even time cannot erase
on through my sorrows
life will go on
the fox:
my last steps
can't leave her
i, the old fox
will take revenge
old man:
i cannot heal your fear and doubts
the void, it waits for us
still, after all the ghosts are howling
you cannot run, you cannot hide
the void, it waits for us
still after all here is no choice
all:
here on this road of no release
pale reign of misery
that even time cannot erase
on through my sorrows
life will go on
the girl:
find me, i'm drowning
then once again
there's nothing left i fear
there's nothing more to say
and no more games to play
to play
we have the chance to turn the pages over
we can write what we want to write
we gotta make ends meet, before we get much older
we're all someone's daughter
we're all someone's son
how long can we look at each other
down the barrel of a gun?
you're the voice, try and understand it
make a noise and make it clear
ohwowowo, ohwowowo
we're not gonna sit in silence
we're not gonna live with fear
ohwowowo, ohwowowo
this time, we know we all can stand together
with the power to be powerful
believing we can make it better
ooooh
we're all someone's daughter
we're all someone's son
how long can we look at each other
down the barrel of a gun?
you're the voice, try and understand it
make a noise and make it clear
ohwowowo, ohwowowo
we're not gonna sit in silence
we're not gonna live with fear
ohwowowo, ohwowowo
ooooh
we're all someone's daughter
we're all someone's son
how long can we look at each other
down the barrel of a gun?
you're the voice, try and understand it
make a noise and make it clear
ohwowowo, ohwowowo
we're not gonna sit in silence
we're not gonna live with fear
ohwowowo, ohwowowo
you're the voice, try and understand it
make a noise and make it clear
ohwowowo, ohwowowo
we're not gonna sit in silence
we're not gonna live with fear
ohwowowo, ohwowowo
you're the voice, try and understand it
make a noise and make it clear
ohwowowo, ohwowowo
we're not gonna sit in silence
we're not gonna live with fear
ohwowowo, ohwowowo
you're the voice, try and understand it
a sense of denial
come witness my trial
the crow has turned into a liar
i'll live, i may die
i've failed though i've tried
but finally i fly
it is the fool
who puts faith in false saviors
the innocent understands
he's still falling
and furthermore
he's now aware
"come spread your wings
awake now"
the enemy within
will soon appear
you're trapped in my mind
ask for the key
don't search for fine lines
there's no release
though i can feel its presence
there's a sign to reveal
then after all
i'm sure i'll keep on falling
they send a sign
when dead winter will come again
there from the ruins i will rise
fear the voice in the dark
be aware now
believe in dark wings and dark words
the shadow returns
fear the voice in the dark
be aware now
black shadows they hide and they wait
but they soon will return
it will never be the same
and nothing remains
i can't find a way
but i'm facing it
oh there will be no savior
i can foresee all the pain
they are about to creep in
"curse me, hate me, hurt me, kill me"
oh they will rest no longer
"paralyzed and frozen
free your mind
you're broken
paralyzed and frozen
learn to roam
don't look back"
on stunning fields of mayhem
i will find no relief
it's just a dream
i wish that i could tell you
the vision fades
there is no sanctuary
what will go up
surely comes down
fear the voice in the dark
be aware now
believe in dark wings and dark words
the shadow returns
fear the voice in the dark
be aware now
black shadows they hide and they wait
but they soon will return
in vain
still i don't understand
so talk to me again
why do i fear these words?
what keeps holding me back?
i hear a voice
it comes from everywhere
"now find a way
cause you're the key
begin to understand"
the descending ends
now i know i won't fly again
on through the mist, i'm facing ground
fear the voice in the dark
be aware now
believe in dark wings and dark words
the shadow returns
fear the voice in the dark
be aware now
black shadows they hide and they wait
but they soon will return
come, i'll show you the end
you're damned, 'cause noone can defy me
just watch these madded creatures
like you, they all once reached out
a war to win
but i'm gonna burn this vision down
call me the father of lies
just watch these saddened creatures
they've turned you into their savior
you'll hold your ground until your last breath
you twist then turn, and now you're falling down
the battle rages on and forever and ever the wheel will turn
let ages come and go the wheel will turn now
the wheel will turn
another ride into obsession
i am reborn, the wheel will turn
the wheel will turn
and i am driven to obsession
all these dying men
try to understand
they all followed the sign
it's the cycle's end
there's no hope
for a while
from the ashes arise
can't save her
enjoy the flames
so precious, so pure
and you try
you're sure to fail
and madness
is the price you've to pay
unholy grounds
witness your last breath
the cycle ends
and you're stumbling
the battle will go on
and forever and ever
it's raging on
let ages come and go the wheel will turn now
the wheel will turn
another ride into obsession
i am reborn, the wheel will turn
the wheel will turn
and i'm driven to obsession
through the flames you'll see me,
you'll be mine, believe me
this is the moment i long for
wake up there's a storm to face and
right now when the land lies bleeding
it's me, i conquer your soul
still i'll be on my way
oh light, let me out here i pray
and over and over and over again
there is no beginning
no end
this war, it still goes on
and forever and ever
i will return
let ages come and go the wheel will turn now
the wheel will turn
another ride into obsession
i am reborn, the wheel will turn
the wheel will turn
and i am driven to obsession
light so serene
true source reign over me
there's no end and
there's no beginning
''you will never be alone''
there's no end and
there's no beginning
''you will never be alone''
so i stand still
in front of the crowd
excited faces
what will be next?
i still don't have a clue
i still don't have a clue

in blame
and life it shall wane

wait for ilian
no ! i'm hawkmoon
oblivion  the war is eternal
oblivion  the battle is endless
they rule the land
they're in command
they hold all strings in hand
they are invisible
out of sight
they've designed a secret place to play their games
a world they're in control
divine law
divine law
be aware
now mind your steps
we are uninvited guests
they may find and catch us
don't forget
do what i say
now connect
don't even ask until we're out of it
everything's at highest stake
come
take a look
we are in
take a breath
but don't forget
it isn't real
it isn't true
an illusion
nothing more
you're part of the game
you're slave to the grind
oblivion
is your key to the otherland
you're part of the game
you're cursed
you're damned
by now you understand
you're part of the game
you're slave to the grind
oblivion
you're welcome to the otherland
you're part of the game
you're cursed
you're damned
by now you understand
we get closer
there's no better way
lullaby lane
fate is on it's way
the inner district is the place you need to know
it's overwhelming
so let's rest here for a while
someone else appears
silently
watch me when i fall down
everything seems real
suddenly
a perfect simulation
come
take a look
breathe it in
artificial wonderlands
we are wandering around
things shall vanish
they won't last
now i know you
understand this world is not true
nothing is real
nothing at all
it's bits and pieces
we walk through
you're part of the game
you're slave to the grind
is your key to the otherland
you're part of the game
you're cursed
you're damned
by now you understand
you're part of the game
you're slave to the grind
oblivion
you've reached the promised land
you're part of the game
you're cursed
you're damned,
welcome to the otherland
wait
i can feel things are not right
do not breathe
don't look behind
there's someone else
the observer
a trick of light
a fading line
the entrance is gone
we can't get out of it
we are slightly losing ground
quick
it is time
we shall go
we better leave
and don't come back
no way to run
nowhere to hide
i fear we are walking aimlessly
you're part of the game
you're slave to the grind
oblivion
is your key to the otherland
you're part of the game
you're cursed
you're damned
by now you understand
you're part of the game
you're slave to the grind
oblivion
welcome to the otherland
you're part of the game
you're cursed
you're damned
you've reached the promised land
you've crossed the line
you've reached the end
you've crossed the line
you've reached the end
i've seen the moon
and the first sunrise
i'll leave it to the memories
and kiss the wind goodbye
for the eldar
i'm trapped inside this dream
of the eldar's
song of doom
i've tasted poison
when i drank the wine of fate
but the fear was in my heart
i realized too late
the house of spirits call
for the eldar
i'm trapped inside this dream
of the eldar's
song of the doom
high's the fee
soon my spirit will return
welcome dawn
your light will take me home
i say farewell
to the eldar
i'm trapped inside this dream
of the eldar's
song of doom
no sign of life did flicker
in floods of tears she cried
"all hope's lost it can't be undone
they're wasted and gone"
"save me your speeches
i know they blinded us all
what you want
you will take it away from me
take it and i know for sure
the light she once brought in
is gone forevermore"
like sorrowful seaguls they sang
"we're lost in the deep shades
the misty cloud brought
a wailing when beauty was gone
come take a look at the sky
monstrous it covered the shore
fearful into the unknown"
quietly it crept in new horror
insanity reigned
and spilled the first blood
when the old king was slain
nightfall
quietly crept in and changed us all
nightfall
quietly crept in and changed us all
nightfall
immortal land lies down in agony
"how long shall we
mourn in the dark
the bliss and the beauty
will not return
say farewell to sadness and grief
though long and hard the road may be"
but even in silence i heard the words
"an oath we shall swear
by the name of the one
until the world's end
it can't be broken"
just wondering how
i can still hear these voices inside
the doom of the noldor drew near
the words of a banished king
"i swear revenge"
filled with anger aflamed our hearts
full of hate full of pride
we screamed for revenge
nightfall
quietly crept in and changed us all
nightfall
quietly crept in and changed us all
nightfall
immortal land lies down in agony
"vala he is that's what you said
then your oath's been sworn in vain
but freely you came and
you freely shall depart
so never trust the northern winds
never turn your back on friends"
"oh i'm heir of the high lord!"
"you better don't trust him"
the enemy of mine
isn't he of your kind and
finally you may follow me
farewell
he said
nightfall
quietly crept in and changed us all
nightfall
quietly crept in and changed us all
nightfall
immortal land lies down in agony
back to where it all began
stop be quite now
out with the light and
then up and down it goes
fly
out with the light
there at the door
the inspiration i've looked for
the spirit of the youth appears
no one ever dares to speak
it's nothing else but fantasy
it's make believe
make believe
no one ever dares to speak
it's nothing else but fantasy
but one day it all will come to life
step out of line
and i'll teach you how to fly
then away we'll go
leave your mark land of mine
leave your mark in the land of mine
the second one to right
and then straight on until morning light
stop be quite now
no irritation
no, not the slightest doubt
we got once
quick, we better hurry
there from the road i sense
the end of fun gets near
wonderful thoughts and imaginations
these things will lift you up
what is it like? you ask me, my dear
will there be fairies or things to fear?
for fairies sake i'd say you better come with me
so soon you'll see
now up and down it goes and round
round and round and round
praise my cleverness
they all follow me
all praise to innocence
that's everything it needs
fly in
fly out
they'll leave it all behind
no one ever dares to speak
it's nothing else but fantasy
it's make believe
make believe
no one ever dares to speak
it's nothing else but fantasy
but one day it all will come to life
life is a map and it is quite confusing
the lights are up now let the play begin
she flies, she flies
into the light she flies
no words like "just" in mind
she's finding neverland
there one day she dies
don't stop it now
she still enjoys the scene
don't stop it now
don't stop it now
don't stop it now
don't stopi it now, now, now
no one ever dares to speak
it's nothing else but fantasy
it's make believe
make believe
no one ever dares to speak
it's nothing else but fantasy
but one day it all will come to life
step aout of line
and i'll teach you how to fly
then away we'll go
leave your mark land of mine
leave your mark in the land of mine
the morning sun of dune
the morning sun of dune
the holy war's
waiting for
the morning sun
the morning sun
the morning sun
the morning sun of dune
there's no tomorrow
the apparition of this land and it's dream
makes me feel i've seen it before
i can taste there's life
everywhere you can find
in the desert of my life
i see it again and again
and again, again, again, again
dark tales has brought the dijahd
like whispering echos in the wind
and i'm a million miles from home
traveler in time
knowing that there's no rhyme
the morning sun is near
first light of dawn is here
the morning sun is near again
the fremen sing that
their kingdom will come
and i'm the leading one
battlefields on our crusade
filled with sardokaurs
killing machines crying
in raising fear they're hiding
where do we go now?
so where is the way?
when i'm a million miles from home
traveler in time
knowing that there's no rhyme
the morning sun i feel
all pain and sorrow
the apparition of my words in these days
makes me feel i've told them before
all my plans will come true
i'll control destiny
in the desert of my life
i've seen it again and again
by my dreams i must find a way
to stop the raging war
i've to choose now
i will leave
my body and seek
and time will stand still
when i've to leave
my body and find
a way back to the world i love
when i'm a million miles from home
traveler in time
knowing that there's no rhyme
close to insanity
beyond the realms i've been
at darkest places
i'm crying
"the dragon flies"
something savage
is yearning for me
i'm waiting afraid for the night
what will be
i've lost myself
a few days ago
it's touching my soul
and a vision of past dreams comes true
welcome to dying
i don't let it out
welcome to dying
look to the mirror it shows what i am
welcome to dying
this town must burn now
welcome to dying
can't you see the dragon's seed bears in me
the one who's been before
many times i terrorized this town
many times and here i start again
now i'm stronger and so cold
cold as ice
returning is my destiny
now i feel it's growing up in me
now i feel it's burning deep in me
i'm not what i was before
could i stop this dream
i'm a stranger to myself
and i cannot control
welcome to dying
i don't let it out
welcome to dying
look to the mirror it shows what i am
welcome to dying
can't you see the dragon's seed bears in me
welcome to dying
the dragon's breath i don't let it out
i'm a savage
it's too late for me
the other side's taking control and i know
there's one way i can walk alone
or the dragon will fly
and a growing fear's all that i feel
welcome to dying
i don't let it out
welcome to dying
look to the mirror it shows what i am
welcome to dying
can't you see the dragon's seed bears in me
welcome to dying
the dragon's breath i don't let it out
welcome to dying
welcome to dying
welcome to dying
welcome to dying
welcome to dying
welcome to dying
can't you see the dragon's seed bears in me
spread my wings and fly away
i spread my wings and fly away
i spread my wings and fly away
he's had enough
he couldn't take anymore
he found a place in his mind
and slammed the door
no matter how they tried
they couldn't understand
they washed and dressed him
fed him by hand
yeah! i've left the world behind
i'm safe here in my mind
i'm free to speak with my own kind
this is my life, this is my life
i'll decide not you
withdrawn he sat there
staring into space
no sign of life
would flicker on his face
until one day he smiled
it seemed as though with pride
the wind kissed him goodbye
and then he died
yeah! i've left the world behind
i'm safe here in my mind
i'm free to speak with my own kind
this is my life, this is my life
i'll decide not you
keep the world with all its sin
it's not fit for livin' in
yeah! i will start again
it can take forever, and ever
whatever, whenever, but i'll still win
how many like him
are they still
who to us all
seem to have lost the will
they lie in thousands
lank and lost
is knowledge worth this bitter cost
beyond the realms of death
he was born in the past time
to take all our pain
the kingdom of heaven's near
the children of this time
must die for his arrive
to let all the legends be true
the prophecy said they'll call king of the jews
he is born now to take all our sins
three kings were searching for this holy child
the journey begins, he has to die
lead
bridge
healing the cripples and taking our pain
he came for the sinner
but what we've said
disciples are following
they are calling his words
salt of the earth and light of the world
ref.:
martyr  we are following you
bless us for eternity
messiah  we are torturing you

jump from the temple and angle will save
show me that you are the son of our god
now take my land with my power you get
rulin' the world of tomorrow
messiah liar our burning desire
he is the king without a crown
we'll set him to his throne
give me 30 p of silver and i'll be your man
higher liar the fallen messiah

the things he done are blasphemy
mob has lost their joy on toy
so let us kill him fast
now drink my blood for the new testament
this is my body you eat
one of you twelve is the one who betrays
better that he's never born
judas you're the chosen one
the world has damned your name
lead
bridge
begin with a kiss
at a cross it will end
the kingdom of heaven we've passed
the sky will turn black and the curtain will fall
the father's crying for his son
the tortured messiah is finding his way
the journey has come to the end
the twelve ones are preaching the words he'd left
they're changing the way of the world but die for
solo
ref.
martyr  we are following you
bless us for eternity
no
fool just another
fool just another
i've been waiting
for signs of god
create
enslaved
behaved
everything is out of control
leave me alone
isolation bears hope
there's something else waiting
a promised destiny
freezing me
i feel restless and low
these days full of sadness
had joyfully changed
into fear
my freakshow will start tonight
don't miss the right time
bright eyes
blinded by fear of life
no merlin is by my side
everything is out of control
everything is out of control
in my future plans
everything is out of control
no one's left to hurt
everything is out of control
sorrow's gone away
broken memories
walking upstairs
step by step
i see the whole world burning
the poet dies in neverland
how it burns
hey, mother stubborn
i really hate you
if you say yes i will say no
ashes to ashes
but dust won't be dust
if you go there
i will go back
bright eyes
blinded by fear of life
betrayed by sunrise
bright eyes
blinded by fear of life
no merlin is by my side
hey, father stubborn
you're ying
and i'm young
i feel alone
who really cares
born into ashes
to lose all the games
with a smiling face
bright eyes
blinded by fear of life
and dark dragons rise
bright eyes
blinded by fear of life
no merlin is by my side
so i sit still in my room, today
winter's here
in summer's season
shall i say
i was wrong
if i'm right
farewell to my last hope
i am god
the only one
i will bring back
freedom to your heart
you won't believe
that blind can see
no one else before me ever knew
the way to paradise
for another bloody crime
i shall return
i am your light on through the night
why am i born
will i fail to rise again
another crucifixion for
another holy war
can't stop what's going on
can't stop what's going on
sooner or later you must understand
my words bring freedom
and rescue for man
what else,
to call me your messiah
oh, i wish there could be another way
cross and nails are already prepared
my sell out
waits till i'm crucified
i will die before my vision ends
why am i born
will i fail to rise again
another crucifixion for
another holy war
can't stop what's going on
can't stop what's going on
wait for the dawn
to take me away
what will be if i fail
another golden calve
never, never ending
pain and agony
hit me, nail me make me god
oh, i haven't been here for a while
in blindness and decay
the circle's been closed, now
my song of the end
i've seen it all
listen crowd
i'll tell you everything
though i have to say
i don't know much
talking about a past
and future secret
most called him once
and future king
far back in the past
i saw his ending
long before it started
i knew his name
he's the one who took the sword
out of the stone
it's how that ancient tale began
i hear it in the cold winds
my song of the end
i had seen it in my dreams
my song of the end
i can't stop the darkening clouds
i feel cold
when i cry out for the bark
take him back to avalon
dwell on for a new age
so long sleep well my friend
take him back to avalon
i will wait and guard
the future king's crown
my song of the end
it was nice but now it's gone
my song of the end
it was fixed the whole time
my song of the end
i saw it all
thus ends the fifth battle
by the treachery of men the field is lost
the night falls and great is the triumph of evil
the league is broken
the last vestige of hope lives in the hidden king
only he troubles the dark one's mind
only he could bring ruin to the black foe
though the land lies down in agony and the curse lives on
a new star shall arise
and a new day shall come, again
extermination thunder the strange one is
back again
lost by our only power it's aura will grind us
out forever
fall into a dark dream that we got once
the part it's real you won't believe
we're watching our own agony many years ago
seven little children stand against the ghost
believing is the answer but you've lost before
find back to your infancy it's time to die
i've been the herdsman you've been my sheep
i find taste on lampskin everything's alright
killing for the thirst for small children sweat
i give them illusions to raise their fear
hear the crying dying child it's music to my ears
feel the sweetness of it's death everything's alright
but there's a new feeling i've never known
there must be a third one a mighty guardian
guardian, guardian, guardian of the blind
now it feel the curse of heaven
guardian, guardian, guardian of the blind
now it feel the curse of the child
dark is it's world. and lonely we're reaching it
again
fear our returning visions to madness we'll
fall
if we can't kill the beast forever
we must die now
one has blown his life away
once we were a circle fighting hand in hand
our weapons were illusions to let it feel the pain
by the sweet taste of our live it call us back again
we'll find the answer it's time to die
by a ritual we've hurt it but we've not kill
little billy you must find your way
believe in you we ask for
but where
we can never find
there must be a sign for the
guardian of the blind
guardian, guardian, guardian of the blind
now it feel the curse of heaven
guardian, guardian, guardian of the blind
now it feel the curse
come to it's world following the sign
guardian, guardian, guardian of the blind
give us the help we're waiting for your sign
guardian, guardian, guardian of the blind
she's opening here eyes
to find the thing
by a touch she's lost
it's waiting for her a long time
the kingdom's lost
cause there's one nail missing
playing with fire
turn of the light
and she'll fall down
playing with her life
but she can't leave it
there's one rhyme in her brain
lead: andr
oh, last night and the night before
tommyknockers, tommyknockers
knocked at your back door
tommyknockers
the pain in my head
the cycle awakes
i'm on my way to oz
i want to drink and she wants to dig
she's in trouble oh i know
there's something going wrong
tommyknockers on their way
what's up in "leighton street"?
oh, last night and the night before
tommyknockers, tommyknockers
knocked at your back door
i'm the hero, i'm back
with weapons and with magic spells
i'll seddle every task
an old, ill and drunken guy
the moon is full of blood
i've found her not, not far from home
i should better get away from here
she's on her way to be another one
playing with fire
she can read my thoughts
it's too late
playing with her life
tommyknockers brought her trouble
the ship in the earth i touch
a vibration is filling me
and music in my head
nose is bleeding
and my fall down
filled me up with pain
you'll be like a tommyknocker
i'll be like you
but there's something going wrong
i read it in your face
oh, last night and the night before
tommyknockers, tommyknockers
knocked at your back door
tommyknockers knocked at your back door
tommyknockers knocked at your back door
i feel cold
facing the darkness
the light's gone away
deep in his castle he said
all land'll be mine
there's one thing for sure
the triumph of shadow is near
deep in his castle they sang
we shall not rest
until all will be thyne
all land is mine
you can be sure
don't dare me
the mighty one screamed
smashed down the light
i will not rest till i'm king
valinor's empty now
allied the elves and men
they shall be damned
rise of fall
a dark tale ends
just wondering how
in the darkness
they found their way
to the right place
children of the sun
second kindred
we call their race
treat them kindly
born in the east
are the nightfearer
they moved westwards
towards the sunshine
they are morning breath like
short's their life
like dawn passes by
when the day comes
the field was lost
and hope had passed away
the sun went down
beyond the sea
dark was the hour
but day shall come again
smashed down the light
i will not rest till i'm king
valinor's empty now
allied the elves and men
they shall be damned
clean my wounds
wash away all fear
let courage be mine
no one hears me crying
no song no tale
which contains all the grief
but
renowned the deeds
and the victims of defeat
sit down on your chair
and look out for your kin
with my eyes you'll see
and with my ears you'll hear
you troubled my day
and you've questioned my strength
but don't mess
with the master of fate
smashed down the light
i will not rest till i'm king
valinor's empty now
allied the elves and men
they shall be damned
i smashed down the light
and dared valinor
i smashed down the light
revenge will be mine
slowly marching on
still we're marching on
it's dark
let's do it now
bring in the sirens
cut of their tongues
do it now
ignore their cries
ignore their cries
now close the door
and leave it
nothing went wrong
the archangel is falling
mourners split
take heart of grace
a ghostly candle light
lit my room at night
son of man
we're breeding wastelands
wastelands
the blood of sirens
on my hands
i can't wash away
still it pours
and stains our land
in bitterness
so cruel
will ages go by
dead sound of misery
come share our sorrows
be one with the hydra
it's drown or burn
i'm exploring bedlam
the time is right to move
furthermore
bring out the dead
turn your back
on the ones you have loved
enjoy the heat of your whore
babylon
hear what the spirit says
there is no sense at all
now come with me
unfold the seals
no sense at all
no sense at all
there is not sense at all
so many times i have failed
pure desperation
still hear the cries
of voices
long gone by
they've gone abroad
and left this world behind
leave me behind
behind the walls i'm crying
the blood of sirens
on my hands
i can't wash away
still it pours
and stains our land
in bitterness
so cruel
will ages go by
dead sound of misery
come share our sorrows
be one with the hydra
so many times i have failed
pure desperation
still hear the cries
of voices
long gone by
they've gone abroad
and left this world behind
leave me behind
behind the walls i'm crying
the blood of sirens
on my hands
i can't wash away
still it pours
and stains our land
in bitterness
so cruel
will ages go by
dead sound of misery
come share our sorrows
be one with the hydra
years ago i came back
this has been my hardest attack
a burning fire's in my brain
i could feel the deadly flame
tales of the magic in my head
to a dark dream i fall in my mind
i hold the key of fortune
to feel the strange thing's in my mind
the stone of ambar i must find
i'll take the chance that day
chorus
halloween, the wizards crown i'll take on
halloween
halloween, but there is no return on halloween
i'm the servant of the blind to cross the
realms of death
the gate is open wide you cannot close
his dungeons deep no place to hide
the times have changed he has to fight
in magic spell i fall
illusions falling in my mind
but where's the key i cannot find
the ritual has begun
chorus
the battle has begun
the warlocks time has come
i pay the price i've to pay
why haven't see the signs
i'm loosing now my life
but cannot die forever life
halloween, the wizards crown i'll take on
halloween
halloween, but there is no return on halloween
halloween, the wizards crown i'll take on
in fact it was close to a real fallout
everything's under control
the speaker said with a serious smile
behind his mask
he knew the truth
i'll bring a new age of better ways
the tv preacher said
just pay today
pay today
world's dressed in black
on earth's judgement day
and i?
i know it can't go on
forbidden signs increase
i'm sitting still at home
and watching
born in a mourning hall
pale clouds feared the unborn child
then it grew up with growing plans
of suicide
born in a mourning hall
shadows left the fear inside
that peter pan will never reach
the other side
it's frightening
exciting to sit at home
and watch the burning fields
get
hypnotized by the tv snake
obey and work hard
and feel no anger
just sympathy for the higher class
there's no chance in changing things
'cause i am
born in a mourning hall
silent cries ran out
when the cradle breaks
broken dreams were unheared on
the other side
born in a mourning hall
shadows left the fear
in the new born child
that peter pan will never reach
the other side
and i'm a part of the machine
a puppet on the strings
a rebel, once
now i'm an old man
oh, i know this can't go on
but the ghost called fear inside
lames my tongue, my nerves, my mind
eternal fall down
someone cut the strings off
i can't move
to get back courage
i've to face the truth
but not today
goodbye
born in a mourning hall
caught inside a web called life
the only way to get out soon
is suicide
born in a mourning hall
pale souls built a frozen world
infected brains
will never reach the other side
the other side
the moon, the sign of hope
it appeared when we left the pain of the icedesert behind
we faced up to the curse and endured misery
condemned we are
we brought hope, but also lies, and treachery
pale faced, the innocent will drown in blood
murdered with dawn
don't ever steal my grief
in the sense of green and dawn is gone
blind my eyes
and i still can see through the mist
through the barrier
there, a place where i fear the most
blind my eyes
my love doesn't matter right now
i will bury my dead and keep
until the end
i won't give up
i won't give up
i crawl to the red fields of blood
there's a grave
there's a rose
drift away
i can hear me say
soon you all shall be free
carry the blessed home
no one's left here but me
and i will sing up your name
call me insane i know
a hope of my heart
and my soul to you son
so pale turns the innocent
and all i feel is pain
suddenly i understand he's gone!
blind my eyes
and i still can see through the mist
through the barrier
there, a place where i fear the most
blind my eyes
my love doesn't matter right now
my love doesn't matter right now
carry the blessed home
no one's left here but me
and i will sing up your name
dreamer, insane i know
what i fear the most i have faced
and that's truth
the grey face, not innocent
though i cry in dismay
i would finally care, move on
is there anyone here who knows how it feels to be right?
blind my eyes
and i still can see through the mist
through the barrier
there, a place where i fear the most
blind my eyes
my love doesn't matter right now
matter right now
matter right now
there are signs on the ring
which make me feel so down
there's one to enslave all rings
to find them all in time
and drive them into darkness
forever they'll be bound
three for the kings
of the elves high in light
nine to the mortal
which cry
slow down and i sail on the river
slow down and i walk to the hill
and there's no way out
mordor
dark land under sauron's spell
threatened a long time
threatened a long time
seven rings to the gnomes
in their halls made of stone
into the valley
i feel down
one ring for the dark lord's hand
sitting on his throne
in the land so dark
where i've to go
slow down and i sail on the river
slow down and i walk to the hill
lord of the rings
light fails at dawn, the moon is gone
and deadly the blood rains
suddenly i found myself in this lands
horror and madness art seen here
the one became, a king of lust
there under lies what's beyond lies
lord of honor
stubborn i and whatever our hope
let's sing to the his glorious barrel of lope
farewell to the brilliant warhol
the faith of us all, lies deep in the dark
when time stands still in the arrant hill
the faith of us all, lies deep in the dark
when time stands still in the arrant hill
i stand alone, no ones by my side
i dare you, come on
you coward, now it's mean
are used like a scar at the selfish lords
like courageous storm
brought me to lord chellington school
lord of lies he cries
cleve me in fears, dark lord of peace
welcome to my lands, you shall in tears
lord of honor
stubborn i and whatever our hope
let's sing to the his glorious barrel of lope
farewell to the brilliant warhol
the faith of us all, lies deep in the dark
when time stands still in the arrant hill
the faith of us all, lies deep in the dark
when time stands still in the arrant hill
batten harm is getting closer
switches hell and now i'm in
brighter than the storm discussing
down with our proudest king
under my fur, hopeless it seems
you trampled my day, i feel pain
lord of honor
stubborn i and whatever our hope
let's sing to the his glorious barrel of lope
farewell to the brilliant warhol
the faith of us all, lies deep in the dark
when time stands still in the arrant hill
the faith of us all, lies deep in the dark
when time stands still in the arrant hill
the elven kings broken, he stumbles and falls
of powering a spell his sprite survives
praise our king
praise our king
praise our king
praise our king
he was the wizard of a thousand kings
and i chanced to meet him one night wandering
he told me tales and he drank my wine
me and my magic man kinda feeling fine
he had a cloak of gold and eyes of fire
and as he spoke i felt a deep desire
to free the world of its fear and pain
and help the people to feel free again
why don't we listen to the voices in our hearts
cause then i know we'll find we're not so far apart
everybody's got to be happy everyone should sing
for we know the joy of life the peace that love can bring
so spoke the wizard in his mountain home
the vision of his wisdom means we'll never be alone
and now i will dream of my magic night
and the million silver stars that guide me with their light
at hilly's show
they didn't know
that the ending of "being" is near
i can feel their voices
the old man cries
"please save the boy
he's caught in a world far behind
from home"
monster anne is crying out
"feel my pain i can't escape"
bad chances for me
altair 4
altair 4
altair 4
chosen by their whispering words
what is left behind?
when purple colours turn to black
can you feel it?
is there time?
can you see it?
is there life?
"fly away and dream"
who can tell me who i am
who i am my friend
i'm an alien so they say
a risk to everyone
no
tell me what do they see
no
tell me what do they feel
no
tell me what do they fear
no
tell me what do they see
i'm a dwarf but i know more than you
and i'm the key to a better life
from terror i could escape
but i need your helping hand
so far from home where i'm left alone
did you hear my crying?
did you hear my crying?
chorus
goodbye my friend
i found you at the end
i say goodbye to all
goodbye my friend
thanks for your helping hand
i say goodbye to all my cries
just say goodbye
no returning nevermore
no returning nevermore
and i'll remember
communication to you is so strange
you i trust to no one no warmths reach your heart
to you i'm the stranger but you're strange to me
you destruct all what is unknown to you
we are together now
and don't you know i'll come back again
i must go now
chorus
i will go home now
i will go home now
much too long i'm forced to stay
in visions i see
so dark and so deep
mankind will destruct all life
see you again i hope i will
see you again at the end?
my tortured soul cannot forget the pain
now i find my way back
i will go home now
i will go home now
chorus
i run through the dark fields
of the plains
reach level 99
the pain cuts deep down
through my vain
how will i break the ice
welcome to my reality
dream forever
sunlight instead of neon light
how will it be
welcome to my grave
and feel the dream is over
nothing can stop me
i reach out for the top
caught in an old cage
the system failed
built up on lies
now i see that i'm alone
in asylum's cage
i'm left alone
ref.:
i'm alive my friend
i can feel the shadows everywhere
i'm alive
i left the shadows
far behind me
another one is waiting in the dark
they say the system keeps
the last chance to survive
caught in this labyrinth
of walls and lots of lies
then i began to understand
there's more above than ice
to reach the top
i crept deep down
the answers given in the past
a sensless worth
in useless brains
magic runes
without a meaning
besides the dark
there should be nothing left
caught in an old cage
the system failed
built up on lies
now i see that i'm alone
in asylum's cage
i'm left alone
ref.
outside they say death is waiting
but it creeps down through the shaft
finds pleasure in our helpless fear
fills empty rooms
with morbid thought
they've locked the door
and hold the key
sitting beside you
when silent screams
changing my mind and dreams
oh, it's never ending
caught in an old cage
the system failed
built up on lies
now i see that i'm alone
in asylum's cage
i'm left alone
ref.
i'm alive
taken the long way
dark realms i went through
i arrived
my vision's so clear
in anger and pain
i left deep wounds behind
but i arrived
truth might be changed by victory
beyond the void but deep within me
a swamp of filth exists
a lake it was of crystal beauty
but arda's spring went by
i've heard the warning
well curse my name
i'll keep on laughing
no regret
no regret
don't fear the eyes of the dark lord
morgoth i cried
all hope is gone but i swear revenge
hear my oath
i will take part in your damned fate
i will always remember their cries
like a shadow which covers the light
i will always remember the time
but it's past
i cannot turn back the time
i don't look back
there's still smoke near the shore
but i arrived
revenge be mine
i will take part in your damned fate
morgoth i cried
it's my oath
so don't fear the eyes
of the dark lord
soon you will be free
set your spirit free
"suddenly i realized
the prophecies
i've never believed in
my deeds were wrong
i've stained the land
and slain my kin
burning soul
there's no release from my sins
it hurts
the curse of fanor runs long
time and only time will tell us
tell: was i right or wrong?
when anger breaks through
i'll leave mercy behind"
i will take part in your damned fate
morgoth i cried
it's my oath
so don't fear the eyes
of the dark lord
i will always remember their cries
like a shadow they'll cover my life
but i'll also remember mine
and after all i'm still alive
once upon a time
no more words to say
find me in the circle
find me in the end
i am the soul collector
dressed in ebony
there are no rules
but only one
there's someone young sister,
caught at the border
let's get in contact
he's either yours or mine
i have thought
that this will never end
and things go on
but nothing will last
only the fool in me believes
there is sense in it
in distant shores of green
it's over now
far out in space
i ride on
time is chasing us all
it's not quite how it seems
it's just a dream
i don't believe
in a soul or in god
it's just twisted
further
you do not understand:
each single breath inspires you
come to an end  expire
rise up my sister
let's cross the border
reveal the secret
one more to burn
i have thought
that this will never end
and things go on
but nothing will last
only the fool in me believes
there is sense in it
in distant shores of green
it's over now
you finally have approached
still
there is something left to do:
draw me and prove
your souls not ripe, yet!
prepare yourself then wait for me
expect the day when i come by
you're released now
for a while you may feel
resurrection
open your eyes
the vision's bleak
and the color is black
far beyond
there's a starving
but dying sun
i have thought
that this will never end
and things go on
but nothing will last
only the fool in me believes
there is sense in it
in distant shores of green
it's over now
there comes the last part and end of our old age
with thunder and lightning the dark lord is taking
the crown of the whole world
his creature will kill me and poisons my soul
to the end i'll fight but i know that the things
that i do are so meanless
oh no
i see the hill but it's so far away
i know i can't reach it
but i try it again and again in my dark dreams
he's waysting my last will how long can i stay here
when the mightiest of all will now
chorus
run for the night burn away
the times of his fall i've to pay
visions of darkness prepared for the last strike
and bloodlust their weapons and madness
you see their
eyes there's no way out
i'm lost in a dark dream and losing control
to the end i'll fight but i know that the things
that i do are so meanless  oh no
i see the hill but it's so far away
i know i can't reach it
but try it again and again in my dark dreams
he's waysting my last will
how long can i stey here
whe the mightiest of all will now
chorus
you see them running in the shadows of the night
it is not what it used to be
they've been scared and they've been anxiously tonight
you them running with the wind they
run for the night
run for the night
run for the night
would you open the door?
son, i know the way
soon the flickering light will grow
leave it to me now
unchained
unchained
would you open the door?
enter the here and now, a new horizon
you'll rise, you'll fall and learn to live
keep the faith, keep the pace
your soul's like water but
your fate is like the wind
here's the new order
hope shall be your guide
praise the new order
now let my spirit go
do you remember
when we were moon knights?
we've slain the dragon
in the room now
yours is the future
your quest for truth
how will it end up
i really do not know
this is no wonderland
just keep in mind
like a spell in certain books
time will change it all
away, oh, please embrace me
away, i will be gone
i'll take a look to see what lies beyond the break of dawn
would you open the door?
there is so much more to say
keep the faith, keep the pace
the soul's like water but
your fate is like the wind
here's the new order
hope shall be your guide
praise the new order
now let my spirit go
will you remember the old rule
and will you fulfill this sacrifice?
done for the future, space for the new
how will it end up, that's up to you
you're on the bridge on the borderline
no matter how you'll never ever leave it
here's the new order
hope shall be your guide
praise the new order
now let my spirit go
times will change
the soul's like water and like rain it will return
live on in healing rain
the past shall find release
alone i walk, hearing a voice
that's calling my name
no one should be here
take no one with you
god, why i didn't care
on through death take me away
to the place time will not fade
colder than dead
darkness, eternity
but look out
a hundred thousand centuries
the sun had never seen
so near but so much too far
eternal place you know what's life
but cannot tell
i can never see you changing
but you look to me
time will never heal your wounds
but you're immortal
hall of the king a vision of the end
hall of the king don't cry for us
don't hear us calling
oh watch out for me hall of the light
my last sign
you find yourself
just take a look
to see you must open your eyes
like a hawk in the sky
a wonder that dies
don't ask me why
you're the birth and you're the end
you've been hurt but you're not dead
discovering you is what should never be
poisoned are our souls
and dark our hearts
ruins we've left to rule the world
destructive are our minds
it's much too late
would you believe in a night like this
a night like this, when visions come true
would you believe in a tale like this
a lay of bliss, a praise in the old lore
come to the blazing fire and
see me in the shadows
see me in the shadows
songs i will sing
of runes and rings
just hand me my harp
this night turns into myth
nothing seems real
but you soon will feel
the world we live in is another skald's
dream in the shadows
dream in the shadows
do you believe there is sense in it
is it truth or myth?
they're one in my ryhmes
nobody knows the meaning behind
the weaver's line
well nobody else but the norns can
see through the blazing fires of time and
all things will proceed as the
child of the hallowed
will speak to you now
see me in the shadows
see me in the shadows
songs i will sing of tribes and kings
the carrion bird and the hall of the slain
nothing seems real
you soon will feel
the world we live in is another skald's
dream in the shadows
dream in the shadows
do not fear for my reason
there's nothing to hide
how bitter your treason
how bitter the lie
remember the runes and remember the light
all i ever want is to be at your side
we gladden the raven now i will
run through the blazing fires
that's my choice
cause things shall procede as foreseen
and the story ends
insanity said coldly
still waiting for the chance
so out of nowhere it will rise
oh, and another journey starts
by the call of the moon
was it really me
i saw in the mirror screaming
i swallowed hate and lies
through a thousand cries
someone's sucking out my energy
what can i do
on this road to nowhere
heart of dragon lies
at the edge of time
and the story ends
insanity said coldly
still waiting for the chance
so out of nowhere it will rise
oh, and another journey starts
into insanity's claws
come with me and join me
a new life's waiting for you
jump through the mirror
leave fear behind
no matter where i tried
the candle light seemed
lost forever
before my vision ends
cathedral
falling tears
we're not alone
there's someone else, too
from the mirror's other side
reflecting the cruel part of your soul
it's time for your choice
what can i do
on this road to nowhere
heart of dragon lies
at the edge of time
and the story ends
insanity said coldy
still waiting for the chance
so out of nowhere it will rise
oh, and another journey starts
by the call of the moon
heart of dragon lies
what can i do
on this road to nowhere
heart of dragon lies
at the edge of time
and the story ends
insanity said coldly
still waiting for the chance
so out of nowhere it will rise
oh, and another journey starts
into insanity's claws
i'm not a king
i'm just a bard
how can i trust
if there's good and bad
the wounds of life
they will remain
at least i found a friend
cause the're only there to do you harm
don't write in starlight
cause the words may come out real
don't hide in doorways
you may find the key that opens up your soul
don't go to heaven cause it's really only hell
don't smell the flowers
they're an evil drug to make you lose your mind
don't dream of women
'cause they'll only bring you down
hey you, you know me you've touched me, but i'm real
i'm forever the one who lets you look and see
can you feel me? i'm danger i'm a stranger
and i
i'm darkness i'm anger i'm pain
i am the master
the evil song you sing inside your brain, drive you insane
don't talk
don't let them inside your mind yeah
run away run away goooo
don't let them in your mind , touch your soul
don't dance in darkness
you may stumble and you're sure to fall
don't write in starlight
cause the words may come out real
don't talk to strangers
cause the're only there to make you sad
don't dream of women
cause they'll only bring you down
out in the distance
there's so much gold
the treasure that i've found
is more than enough
far to be the hill we've to go
over the mountain and seas
to the old hill
where the old dragon sleeps
blind in the dark dungeon's night
so god please take me away from here
and gollum shows the way right out
i'm alive
the dying dragon brought trouble and pain
and horror to the halls of stone
i'll take the mighty stone
and leave the dwarves behind
ice and fire and forest we passed
and horror in the halls of stone
trolls in the dark
the dawn took them all
caught in the wood
by the wooden kings' men
but now i'm alone
'cause i've made up my mind
by the spell of gold
the king under the mountain
will risk the great war
oh what a fool
he's losing control
so i am trying to find a way
blind in the dark dungeon's night
then darkness comes from the northern side
and thorin clears his mind
when the moonchild is crying
and silence has broken
the darkest truth
the things she remembered
had never been her own
replicant or human
i know the way to show
what do i see
what will i find
know the answer inside
it's your last step
time what is time
i wish i knew how to tell you why
it hurts to know
aren't we machines
time what is time
unlock the door
and see the truth
then time is time again
whispering
these dreams were never mine
it's cold inside
it's gone forever
the things he saw
who can say what's wrong or right
the vision of a free life
his eyes had seen it all
for what
he's asking
the vision, vision, vision
i know it's all a lie
i'll remember his past life
and i'll remember time
what did i see
what have i done
god i knew the answers
when he felt so tired
time what is time
come lock the door don't let me in
i am the one your destiny
time what is time
reality  it hurts me so
when time is time again
look into my eyes
feel the fear just for a while
i'm a replicant and i love to live
is it all over now
only these years
i'll leave but i'm singing
time what is time
he saw it clearly it's too late
it does not heal but it lets us forget
time what is time
we'll never know
so don't take care
then time is time again
should i forget
the way i feel
god he knows how long i tried
feel there is no reason to cry
i live my life
in fortune dreams forever
where are these silent faces
i took them all
they all went away
now you're alone
to turn out every light so deep in me
hold on, to late
will i ever see them back again
or did they all die by my hand
or where they killed
by the old evil ghost
who had taken
the ocean
of all my dreams
which were worth to keep
deep inside my heart
i wish i
could get them back
from the everflow
before they'll fade away
imaginations from the other side
far out of nowhere
it got back to my mind
imaginations from the other side
far out of nowhere
it got back to my mind
out of the dark
back to the light
then i'll break down
the walls around my heart
imaginations from the other side
where's the ocean's daughter
was peter pan in mordor
no one's there to keep alive
all these fairy tales
may i return to oz
will i meet the "tin man"
"coward lion" where are you
without brain the scarecrow's lost
in the middle of the lake
stranded in the real world
left in a world
no place for daydreams
serious life
i fall into
i fall into a dark hole
and i can't come out
do you know if merlin did exist
or frodo wore the ring
did corum kill the gods
or where's the wonderland
which young alice had seen
or was it just a dream
i knew the answers
now they're lost for me
imaginations from the other side
far out of nowhere
it got back to my mind
imaginations from the other side
far out of nowhere
it got back to my mind
out of the dark
back to the light
then i'll break down
the walls around my heart
imaginations from the other side
i hope there is a way back
with my talisman
so i look into myself
to the days when i was just a child
come follow me to wonderland
and see the tale that never ends
don't fear the lion nor the witch
i can't come back
i'm lost but still i know
there is another world
i've lost my battle before it starts
my first breath wasn't done
my spirit's sunken deep
into the ground
why am i alone
i can hear my heartbeat
silence's all around
see hat will rise
so don't come closer
fear your child
born with a king's heart
but fate fooled me
and changed my cards
no one asked if i want it
if i like it
pain inside is rising
i am the fallen one
a figure in an old game
no joker's on my side
i plunged into misery
i'll turn off the light
and murder the dawn
turn off the light
and murder the dawn
nothing else,
but laughter is around me
forevermore
no one can heal me
nothing can save me
no one can heal me
i've gone beyond the truth
it's just another lie
wash away the blood on my hands
my father's blood
in agony we're unified
i never wanted to be
what they told me to be
fulfill my fate then i'll be free
god knows how long
i tried to change fate
pain inside is rising
i am the fallen one
a figure in an old game
no joker's on my side
i plunged into misery
i'll turn off the light
and murder the dawn
turn off the light

the giant's lost
and all round him
destructed for what
they all knew what it meant
but they couldn't change it
lord they had gone too far
leave them alone
it's all gone
what is left behind
on a desert we called earth
when the last whale went away
did they ever see the tears
don't fear your last step
from the theatre of pain
and the children will love your singing
from the sea
the sea is calling
now we've to leave it
the sea was clear
on the day i was stranded
answers i'd known
to keep this all alive
but i can't change it
forever
now i'm gone
and it seems that life had never existed
so we left the dark and cold
all i left behind are my tears
don't fear your last step
from the theatre of pain
and the children will love your singing
from the sea
the sea is calling
i hear them calling
the field is lost
everything is lost
the black one has fallen from the sky and the towers in ruins lie
the enemy is within, everywhere
and with him the light, soon they will be here
go now, my lord, while there is time
there are places below
and you know them too
i release thee, go
my servant you'll be for all time
as you command
my king
i had a part in everything
twice i destroyed the light and twice i failed
i left ruin behind me when i returned
but i also carried ruin with me
she, the mistress of her own lust
now the time has come for me to leave this land
take my charge with pride sacrifice
running and hiding i'm left for the time
to bring back the order of divine
hunted by goblins no gandalf to help
with swords in the night
oh the last part of the game
decision of death and life
blood for sauron they'll call tonight
the final battle cry
running and hiding i'm left for the time
to bring back the order of divine
there exist no tales and hobbits are crying for all
children of death
i have a dream the things you've to hide for
deliver our kingdom and our reich
don't fall in panic just give me the thing
that i need or i kill
don't run away for what have i done
oh majesty your kingdom is lost
and you'll leave us behind
oh majesty your kingdom is lost
and ruins remind of your time
now come back
oh majesty your kingdom is lost
and you'll leave us behind
oh majesty your kingdom is lost
and ruins remind of your time
now come back
run, run, run
out on the water
the island of the dead that live
there they dwelt
until they left the world and
still their deeds live forth in songs
you are now my guest, forever
i am lost in the black chamber
there's no way to turn back
it takes me down forevermore
and death would be so sweet
i'm possessed by the old creature
who had planned all
to take my soul
too late for me
in my hands
it liest i thought
but i failed
now he's in me
my soul is lost
in his black chamber
i'm gone
the world turned innocent
can you hear me?
i confess i'm no redeemer
can you hear me?
what shall i do?
i witnessed everything
faith won't leave me
mind my tongue
it's like a fire
faith don't leave me
glow into words
this is the edge now
it's all we're living for
rain on me
love, you will rain on me
and at the end i
boast in the cross and now
love reigns the god incarnation
i've shaped
out there is a world on fire
accursed the hanged one
divine love for free
what a fateful night
and a grateful life
the choir echoes
"every man his price"
price, love, love, love, love
light my agony
and crucify me
void the law
at the ninth hour
void the law
at the ninth hour
this is the edge now
it's all we're living for
rain on me
love you will rain on me
and at the end i
boast in the cross and now
love reigns the god incarnation
i've shaped
the world turns flesh again
no more fear in
mystified the final hours
no more fear in
passover the brook
time it is at hand
obscure the facts
a passion play
this is the edge now
it's all we're living for
rain on me
love, you will rain on me
and at the end i
boast in the cross and now
love reigns the god incarnation
i've shaped
hallowed be thy name
hallowed be thy name
no more fear in
come take a look
the old symbols they move
wounds still bleed
that's creed
come take a look
the old symbols they move
wounds still bleed
that's creed
come take a look
the old symbols they move
can you see me?
come take a look
at the depth of my soul
white hair and red eyes
he's holding the crown
the king of the island
elric of melnibon
he's born for destruction
he's ruled by the gods
eternal hero
the scale of the universe
blood on his hands
he's born a thousend times
why don't we feel the signs
from the dragon king
before the end of the fire his journey starts
the eagle's spreading his wings
following his fate
he's ruled from anywhere
leads him to the truth
it's deep inside
hail to the king
they'll bless tonight
he's the saviour of our time
in a dark land far behind
no one knows it's name
there's a dark sword cold as ice
a blade created for him
stormbringer cries
for the soul of everyone
stormbringer crues
"the ending has begun"
run fast to madness
forever i
run fast to madness
leave him alone
run fast to madness
forever i
run fast to madness
leave him alone
destiny's calling him back to the island
and time ? time is standing still
time is not real
time is not real
armed with weapons awaiting the fight
he's leading the dragon
the sun will never rise
creatures are lurking
in darkness they hide
high in the sky the dragon king is flying
hail to the king of melnibon
he's the saviour of our time
mourning deserts rottingness
blade of dark will rise
gods devine
are hiding in the dark
needing elric's hand
stormbringer cries:
"i'm forged in darkest time"
stormbringer cries:
"the ending has begun"
many songs i've written
about the things i saw
my inner soul's a wasteland
i can't run away from here
try to find them
all the lost thoughts in my mind
i woke up on a hill
so many times before
yesterday seems like a dream no more
frozen memories laughing
they don't let me find the truth
am i born to be a king
or a jester of the fools
chorus
you're the mystical old bard
on your journey through the dark
mystical old bard
your journey through the dark
i can't remember my name
i never knew how to find my home
i can't remember my name
come tell me where will it end
i'm the chosen one
to perform all these things
but not for me
in illusions and reality
i'm on my journey through the dark
i'm on my journey through the dark
chorus
i can't remember
will i ever find myself
the distance is growing
my hope has gone away
a flash of light but nothing changes
when will it end
which part of me remains
soon i'll be back
on my ferryboat of tales
where oblivion reigns
it will take all of me
chorus
noldor
blood is on your hands
your bane's
a tearful destiny
black clouds will carry
rain of blood
i've seen it rain
we were lost
on grinding ice
in fear and hunger
dead winter reigned
in araman
you can't escape
from my damnation
nor run away
from isolation
guilty spoke the one
this deed can't be undone
hear my words
fear my curse
chorus: 
i know where the stars glow
and the sky's unclouded
sweet the water runs my friend
but noldor
blood is on your hands
tears unnumbered
you will shet and dwell in pain
your homeless souls
shall come to me
there's no release
slain you might be
slain you will be
slain you will be
and the lost
who will not reach the
house of spirits
will grow old and weary
chorus: repeat 3 & 4th verses
i've seen this bitter end
as i've foreseen
the storm and ice
and i could see it
how a million died
and i?
the blame's on me
cause i was not there
chorus: repeat 3 & 4th verse
dead winter reigns
and tomorrow's still unknown
lies
condemned and betrayed
now everything is said
see my eyes
are full of tears
and a cruel price
we've paid
but still i can't claim
that i'm innocent
lost
how to? we're here to praise your name,
blazing sun and a bitter death
you're a guardian across the gate
wake up there is a new dawning
wake up the witches wait
for you remember the mirror
when she looked in you are born
and the born in the middle of margret

a glimpse of life
from somewhere deep within

extermination thunder the strange one is
back again
lost by our only power it's aura will grind us
out forever
fall into a dark dream that we got once
the part it's real you won't believe
we're watching our own agony many years ago
seven little children stand against the ghost
believing is the answer but you've lost before
find back to your infancy it's time to die
i've been the herdsman you've been my sheep
i find taste on lampskin everything's alright
killing for the thirst for small children sweat
i give them illusions to raise their fear
hear the crying dying child it's music to my ears
feel the sweetness of it's death everything's alright
but there's a new feeling i've never known
there must be a third one a mighty guardian
guardian, guardian, guardian of the blind
now it feel the curse of heaven
guardian, guardian, guardian of the blind

dark is it's world. and lonely we're reaching it
again
fear our returning visions to madness we'll
fall
if we can't kill the beast forever
we must die now
one has blown his life away
once we were a circle fighting hand in hand
our weapons were illusions to let it feel the pain
by the sweet taste of our live it call us back again
we'll find the answer it's time to die
by a ritual we've hurt it but we've not kill

wake up when the crow will call
there is no truth
there are no rules
there's no plot here
it's twisted
we're still on course
my friend
down to the abyss  orcus lane
shelter of your memories
shelter of your pain

we sail through miracles
dream on if you dare
straight through the mirror
we'll sail on through the air
i feel

when everything's burning
awake
it's not safe
i'm coming down to you again
we'll sail on mircales and then
if you don't mind
i'll sing a song
a sort of lullaby this time
when you're asleep
i'm back again
a world of miracles in hand
if you don't mind
i'll sing a song
a sort of lullaby this time
we're on our way now

straight through the mirror
we'll sail on through the air
there's magic everywhere

wake up when the crow will call
wake up when the crow will call
guardian, guardian, guardian of the blind
guardian, guardian, guardian of the blind
guardian, guardian, guardian of the blind
guardian, guardian, guardian of the blind
have you forgotten him
far from the land
where the sun is born
down in the wood "caladon"
do you know the place
where the light is never seen
and all the hopes are turned
by the final cry
turned to stone
turned to stone
turned to stone
turned to stone
whispering tunes in the wind
all hopes are gone with the night
when the old man will never come back
remember his words and his songs
and we see the raven's flying in the distance
but no wizard's singing his song
somebodies out in the night
i fly in time
the last candle will burn
there's hope for everyone
when the last candle burns high
oh it's time for life
the elves and gnomes have to hide
when the moon is showing it's face
and raging orcs will set their traps
and the forest will burn
they hate green trees
and love the dark
they don't understand
that they're caught and left alone
they feel the magic in the wind
they're just fear the old man's song
solo: kai
ref.: somebodies...
corrupted old gnom
betrayer of all
you know so much about all
what is your price?
gnom:
"too much, too much
you cannot pay with your silver and your gold
there's just a little chance to save the wizard's life
there's just a little chance for all you fools
now pay"
lead: andr
and so i walk across the land
and hope to hear the wizard's song
ref.: somebodies... 2x
outro: somebodies out there
i feel there's somebody
somebodies out there
i feel there's somebody
just let me out of here
speak to me
it all would be easier
i want to talk to you
who is that?
do i hear a whisper?
or do i hear a cry?
across the brown land
the stumps of time
oh turn the wheel and heal me
since moonlights fade
i'm empty  heal me
i'm in search of the lion heart
i am ashamed
i myself can't make it
drown ulysses
drown here in the silence
cause down to hades i've gone
but i cannot get out
down below
i can't free my mind
soon i will fade away
down below
i can't free my mind
soon i will fade
"tic tac" is the message
and the lunatic fears
he is no more
speak to me
it all would be easier
while i'm passing by
what's that?
do i hear a whisper?
or do i hear a cry?
across the brown land
the ghost arrives
pick up my bones and
tell me
is this the "lake of fire"?
hell?
please
i'm in search of the lion heart
nobody else
but the pure can save me
drown ulysses
drown here in the silence
cause down to hades i've gone
but i cannot get out
ruins rule my memories
i can't recall the signs
invite the dead
then silence struck my mind
silence is madness
"tic tac tic tactic"
says the clock
just let me out of here
speak to me
it all would be easier
i want to talk to you
hear me
welcome to this sad place
and hand me what is mine
i'm the theban prophet
the dead and blind
and from the sea you'll feel me
then you'll breath out gently
leave me
i'm in search of the lion heart
i am ashamed
i myself can't make it
drown ulysses
drown here in the silence
cause down to hades i've gone
but i cannot get out
give it to me
i must have it
precious treasure
i deserve it
where can i run
how can i hide
the silmarils
gems of treelight
their life belongs to me
oh it's sweet how the
darkness is floating around
we are following
the will of the one
through the dark age
and into the storm
and we are following
the will of the one
through the dark age
and into the storm
lord i'm mean
blackheart show me
what you hold in your hand
i still hunger for more
release me
from my pain
give it to me
how i need it
how i need it
how i need it
where can i run
how can i hide
the silmarils
gems of treelight
their life belongs to me
oh it's sweet how the
darkness is floating around
we are following
the will of the one
through the dark age
and into the storm
and we are following
the will of the one
through the dark age
and into the storm
lord i'm mean
i did my part
now it's your turn
and remember
what you've promised
so let me out of it
out of the cold
to bring back light and hope for all
and so if i could get you in
just for a little while
into the songs of sorrow
you might understand
where am i now
beyond the dawn
where hope's turned to dust
at all
immortal love's
fooled by the hands of doom
that love means death
i realized too soon
caught in the afterlife
i've gone too far
when sorrow sang softly and sweet
the air was filled with tears
full of sadness and grief
when sorrow sang softly and sweet
i feel like screaming
but i can't breath in
shall i wane right now
i will not leave this
world of living
till she has said
goodbye
out in the cold
i still wait for her call
and her last kiss
it shall be release
i can't forget her
her face will not leave
from the depths of my soul
i long for her
so i heard all about it
her voice's so clear
she's woven both themes in there
moved me to tears
the world shall hear this sad song
song of sorrow song of grief
can't change the way of his kind
can't change the way of her kind
can't believe the things i see
that happens in the state
by a mortal distance that i can't believe
self destructive infernal
to save us from the breed
but i know that it is all a lie
star wars begin now
his bombs come exploding
to bring back the death of the night
no mercy he's knowing
how strong he must show us
for the last film you all get a part
be by my side
or you've to die
believe what i do is the right
soon armageddon
last hours are running now
the final solution begins
the words of a madman
no children to tell them
for what they'll not see in the light
choose by your voice
he kills and destroys
at the end you must die for the night
in earlier chess games
we're playing the part of a soldier
but now we are not qualified
to save our own life
the traps are all placed by command
they are ready to strike
we live and we'll die
by the lies to believe
try to escape from this suicide dreams
or past time will come back again
hiroshima is a joke to that what will come
at the end of the game we all die
die now
battalions of fear
they search and they scream
for the american dreams
battalions of fear
the way of r.r.
to show he is the star
battalions
star wars
with hands full of blood
he talks about peace
with snake poisoning tongue
he's praying
el salvador and vietnam
you soon fast forget
but you satisfy on afghanistan
you've been the master
you kill with a laughter
your screams of peace are wrong and loud
cause so we are and here we are
we scream and shout!
your laughing about all the fools
scream and shout!
with power of evil they stand
taking on water,
sailing a restless sea
from a memory,
a fantasy.
the wind carries
into white water,
far from the islands.
don't you know you're
never going to get to france.
mary, queen of chance, will they find you?
never going to get to france.
could a new romance ever bind you?
walking on foreign ground,
like a shadow,
roaming in far off
territory.
over your shoulder,
stories unfold, you're
searching for sanctuary.

now you all know the bards and their songs
when hours have gone by, i'll close my eyes
in a world far away we may meet again
but now hear my song about the dawn of the night
let's sing the bards' song
tomorrow will take us away far from home
no one will ever know our names but the bards' songs will remain
tomorrow will take it away the fear of today
it will be gone due to our magic songs
there's only one song left in my mind
tales of a brave man who lived far from here
now the bards' songs are over and it's time to leave
no one should ask you for the name of the one
who tells the story
tomorrow will take us away far from home
no one will ever know our names but the bards' songs will remain
tomorrow all will be known and you're not alone
so don't be afraid of the dark and cold
'cause the bards' songs will remain they all will remain
by the ruins he stands
and he's waiting for me
to enter tanelorn
his paths seems strange
but they're always planned
seldom he succeeds
about his own fate
he tries to conquer it
again and again
but at last he's almost
a ruined man
not a king or god
who's searching for
a place called tanelorn
far beyond your dreams
on our quest for tanelorn
we lose our way
on our quest for tanelorn
he's waiting
he's waiting for me
he's waiting
he's waiting for me
spiritus sanctus  vita aeterna
darkness falling down on me
darkness  the eternal battle rises
i know the answers
although they don't exist
i'm just a mortal illusion
on our quest for tanelorn
we lose our way
on our quest for tanelorn
so i'm his companion
through space and through time
his eternal servant
he's calling me
so i must leave
to any life
to another world
far beyond your dreams
to know the truth
just for a while
he's longing for a place
where he can find himself
deliverance
it could be everywhere
how can he find
he's waiting for me
and for your tanelorn
on our quest for tanelorn
we lose our way
on our quest for tanelorn
we lose our way
on our quest for tanelorn
we lose our way
on our quest for tanelorn
we're left alone
high in the sky where eagles fly
morgray the dark enters the throne
open wide the gate, friend
the king will come
blow the horn and praise
the highest lord
who'll bring the dawn
he's the new god

the chaos can begin

there are signs on the ring
which make me feel so down
there's one to enslave all rings
to find them all in time
and drive them into darkness
forever they'll be bound
three for the kings
of the elves high in light
nine to the mortal
which cry
slow down and i sail on the river
slow down and i walk to the hill
and there's no way out
mordor
dark land under sauron's spell
threatened a long time
threatened a long time
seven rings to the gnomes
in their halls made of stone
into the valley
i feel down
one ring for the dark lord's hand
sitting on his throne
in the land so dark
where i've to go
slow down and i sail on the river
slow down and i walk to the hill
lord of the rings
follow the blind
your journey, your last hope, it can begin
these passing dreams
were real no fantasy
there are more things than we know
come take my hand
searching for the talisman you'll find it
on another plane far from all time
maybe you wonder while you see
the same faces
everywhere
you can't find yourself in it
cause you're a part
i'm another
strange my feelings
where am i here
for a short time
i remember i had been here
i'm alone, follow me!
calling you, follow me!
i'm alone, follow me!
follow me
follow me it's my time
follow me
follow the blind
wandering around in my darkest dreams
iron shadows are lurking at me
in this desert the tyrant's calling
on the run to save my love
she's full of pain
the queen is lying far behind
in an endless dream
before i thought i was dreaming
a strange voice whispers in my ears
you're the rat in the trap
return, or pain will come to you
i'm alone, follow me !
calling you, follow me !
i'm alone, follow me !
follow me
follow me it's my time
follow me
follow the blind
i'm alone
no!
the faithful crowd is gathered here
soon they'll appear
the high and mighty show up
the king is in doubts
"apart from this beggar here
there's no one like you my dear
tasting my lips
no one but you and him"
round the fire everyone should sing
and praise the gracious queen
round the fire everyone should dance
and we praise the handsome knight
forever and ever we both will be one
the maiden, the fair and the young fell in love
will you still wait for me
will you still cry for me
come and take my hand
will you still wait for me
will you still cry for me
come and take my hand
there's a moment in life
when all the years will pass by
and the eyes filled with tears
we once shed
we recognize failures
the desperate cries
of the ones who believed in our lies
wherever i'll go you'll be with me
my first though and my last though
we'll depart in bitterness
one day you'll understand
carry on, beloved maiden, mine
cary on or we have to pay the price
will you still wait for me
will you still cry for me
come and take my hand
will you still wait for me
will you still cry for me
come and take my hand
yesterday's memories
and melodies
are gone with the wind so sad
snowwhite her hands and golden her hair
but she's not the one out in the emptiness
where everything's pale
there is no sign of you
i'm alone
how i wish you should be here
i'm alone
telling me it's alright
come rest your head
come rest your head
come rest your head
come rest your head
i'm alone and sadness
reigns in my heart
as long as we live
it won't go away
we are one
but torn apart
will you still wait for me
will you still cry for me
come and take my hand
will you still wait for me
will you still cry for me
come and take my hand
proudly it stands
until the worlds end
the victorious banner of love
hallowed be the fatherland
god he knows
how long i'd been away
from here i did start for a search so
full of decease
i still hear my cryouts
from the old cellar's inside
born in the days of medieval
my inner voice
is always asking why
i came from nowhere
without a task, without a name
no fear of evil
fate, so god please lead me through
forgotten realms
mysterious dreams
in sunless rooms i'd sworn
i'll finish what i started, once
i'll find my holy grail
in the holy land
returning of the miracles
it's my own requiem
the jester's tears
they are inside me
agony's the script for my requiem
returning of the miracles
it's my own requiem
is the script already written
jester's tears i cry
yes, i cry
i went out of my mind
in desert lands
insanity's pawn
out of control
much too long i've been isolated
from my thoughts
enclosed by the leader's spell
bewildered to marc
as a glory knight
and i tried
still i hear the scream of thousands:
"crucify, crucify
take it all
our gold, our home, our life,
but we didn't kill your christ!!
reach out for your holy grail
enslave us and make us
your god's sacrifice!!"
returning of the miracles
it's my own requiem
the jester's tears
they are inside me
agony's the script for my requiem
returning of the miracles
it's my own requiem
is the script already written
jester's tears i cry
yes, i cry
still i'm confused
if i was dreaming
too late i realized
i'd been another fool
i pay the price
returning of the miracles
it's my own requiem
the jester's tears
they are inside me
agony's the script for my requiem
returning of the miracles
it's my own requiem
is the script already written
jester's tears i cry
thus he died
nom the wise
lord of the caves and friend of man
fair, and noble
most beloved of the noldor race
paid the price, he redeemed the oath
farewell my friend, farewell
in deserts i was preaching
the hand of god was with me
baptized with water and i praised
the one who came behind me
to save us all with the holy ghost
a prophet of the fools i've been lost
i'm sure you're there wandering around
but do you care for me
i'm alone
you talk of love not for me
in my dungeon cold i could think about
all the things you've said
but i can't understand you famous son
i left the way of heaven
or did you lead me from it
no no turning back
i'm banished from sanctuary
the darkness in me is filling me with pain
there's no way to turn back for eternity
in shadows i'm walking
and caught in loneliness
deliverance i wait for but how long?
are you the one who should come
show me the light in you
or should we wait for someone?
another!
no no turning back
i'm banished from sanctuary
the darkness in me is filling me with pain
there's no way to turn back for eternity
your reich should come to this world
your way smoothed by my blood, friend
my might will decrease but you'll get
high, yes so much higher
be careful of the rats, friend
cause they'll never sleep
before they catch you, too
the blind can see the sun
cripples walk alone
the deaf can hear my words
they believe just believe
they believe in me
look! the signs are near
to perform my task
to perform my way
to perform the way i walked
the way of the crucifix
i hear the hangman coming
i wait for execution
i came from far
beyond your reality
the ocean of time
it's the odyssey of mine
i am the narrator
and now i'll tell you
where i've been
and what i saw
and how it ends
welcome to the wasteland
in a world which is turning faster
where i'm alone for a while
it's turning faster
away from light straight to the dark
the march of time it has begun
i'm caught in an ancient dream so bright
and then the march of time begins
the man in black he waits
behind this last task
it's full of pain
to sacrifice the only son
the legions of the lost
wait in the old mine
they try to stop me
the battle it has begun
so i'm not afraid
to walk down to the wasteland
i'm so alone on my way
and i don't fear that dusty god forsaken path
somewhere far beyond
chorus
somewhere far beyond
the march of time it has begun
somewhere far beyond your reality
and then the march of time begins
look at my soul
and behind
there are some things
i've to hide from you
i'm following the black man
i'm losing control
and i don't care
what's happening to the boy
welcome to the new world
one more step to the dark tower
and my whole body's in flames
i'm looking for those healing things to be prepared
the march of time it has begun
i'm caught in a prisoner's dirty life
and then the march of time begins
the prisoner did bring the healing spell
the queen of shadows found herself in pain
and death brings answers to us all
what will i find
when the dark tower appears
will it be the end
or just a new quest after all
i am the narrator
and now i'll tell you
where i'd been
and what i saw
and how it ends
chorus
look around and see
the world is turning fast
faster day by day
somewhere far beyond
i'll try to change it
if i can  somewhere far beyond
there's only one chance
and it lies  somewhere far beyond
somewhere far beyond
the march of time it has begun
the march of time it has begun
if everybody had an ocean
across the u. s. a.
then everybody'd be surfin'
like california
you'd seem 'em wearing their baggies
huarachi sandals too
a bushy bushy blonde hairdo
surfin' u. s. a.
you'd catch 'em surfin' at del mar
ventura county line
santa cruz and trestle
australia's narabine
all over manhattan
and down doheny way
everybody's gone surfin'
surfin' u.s. a.
we'll all be planning that route
we're gonna take real soon
we're waxing down our surfboards
we can't wait for june
we'll all be gone for the summer
we're on surfari to stay
tell the teacher we're surfin'
surfin' u. s. a.
haggerties and swamies
pacific palisades
san anofree and sunset
redondo beach l. a.
all over la jolla
at waimia bay
everybody's gone surfin'
surfin' u.s. a.
everybody's gone surfin'
surfin' u.s. a.
everybody's gone surfin'
surfin' u.s. a.
awaiting my last breath
the mirror calls my name
it's showing me the way
into the dark
the bridge appears
i jump into the dark side
and hear the voice it's cold as ice
"welcome to reality"
where am i now?
darkness surrounds
can't go forward
can't go back
i see planets dying
i fall into the light
a new universe awakes
i'm a traveler in time
pray for the light
where's the key
to the gate
of a new life  no
i search for deliverance
but i cannot find
chorus
look behind the mirror
i'm lost in the twilight hall
once i'll be back for a moment in time
that's when the mirror's falling down
take me away
from the place i've been
to another life
in another world
a sign of life
surrounds me now
the bridge appears in the dark
i'm free
i fly alone
leaving the darkness now, forever?
the memories of children
and the wisdom of many lifes
burns deep in me
where will the light go to?
where will the light go to?
is this deliverance?
is it the end?
chorus
i'm back there's a new chance for me
and all my memories are gone
i can feel what's happening to me
and the mirrow will burst
chorus: x2
now truly i am king of the world
master of fate
damned shall thy house be
thou shall not question my power
nor shall thou defy me further
taste the poison
feel that this is life
hallowed be the game
of life and innocence
god's waiting for him
join us at the road to fate
there are no two paths
feel the pain
which steps into his life
agony
he'll be crucified
death awaits
knocking at his door
agony
leave him
the clock will strike the end
hell or heaven
reflect and fade away
ref.:
ashes to ashes, dust to dust
the life clock strikes and you obey
like a candle light that fades
ashes to ashes, dust to dust
when the life clock strikes you will obey
time isn't here to stay
ashes to ashes, dust to dust
the life clock strikes and you obey
a light shows the right way
morning is whispering in my head
too late to say goodbye
too late
the last breath's done
deliverance at all
he's born to find this end
i am the one
the one who's calling
obey my call to the cemetery
and don't be afraid
to step into the dark
be sure that my voice
will take you home
ref.:
ashes to ashes, dust to dust
the life clock strikes and you obey
like a candle light that fades
ashes to ashes, dust to dust
when the life clock strikes you will obey
time isn't here to stay
solo
no hope he'd waited so long
this can't be god's will
he surrendered long ago
there was no real chance
ashes to ashes and dust will be dust
ashes to ashes, you all will be dust again
the clock had struck the end
up to heaven
reflexions fade away
ref. 1st
taste the poison
feel that this is life
hallowed be the game
a black swan
is born that night
the misty pond
has got a new king
got a new king
so what can we do
with our lives
when it all begins
it's hard and
it's cruel
will grace die in pain?
will light ever rise again?
i'm trapped in darkness
still i reach out for the stars
i'm moving in silence
i leave it all far behind
oh at dawn
i'll face the edge of thorns
oh at dawn
i'll pray at the edge of thorns
oh at dawn
i'll face the edge of thorns
let us march on
to the fields of sacrifice
i'm wondering why
i'll carry on
will i betray myself
to rise
in the silence
it's time to explain
and
search for truth in lies
useful lies
needless love's damned
what can we do with our lives
when it all begins
oh at dawn
i'll face the edge of thorns
oh at dawn
i'll pray at the edge of thorns
oh at dawn
i'll face the edge of thorns
come follow me
and you will see
how it will be
when all the pain is gone away
oh at dawn
i'll face the edge of thorns
oh at dawn
i'll pray at the edge of thorns
oh at dawn
i'll face the edge of thorns
let us march on
though there's no hope at our side
let us be brave
though by glory we are denied
but
don't you think
it's time for us
to bring to an end
come play the song of death
the wisdom in us both
will make it
special guaranteed
play the song of death
i'm lost in the depths of his eyes
i can't flee
inner pain caused insanity
it's deep within
the fear and the hunger
enslaved and denied
by my love and my enemies
i'm the ill gotten son
light fails at dawn
the moon is gone
and deadly the night reigns
deceit
finally i've found myself
in these lands
horror and madness i've seen here
for what i became a king of the lost?
barren and lifeless the land lies
bridge:
lord of all noldor
a star in the night
and a bearer of hope
he rides into his glorious battle alone
farewell to the valiant warlord
chorus repeat 2x:
the fate of us all
lies deep in the dark
when time stands still at the iron hill
i stand alone
noone's by my side
i'll dare you
come out
you coward
now it's me or you
he gleams like a star
and the sound of his horn's
like a raging storm
proudly the high lord
challenges the doom
lord of slaves he cries
slowly in fear
the dark lord appears
welcome to my lands
you shall be damned
bridge
chorus
the iron crowned
is getting closer
swings his hammer
down on him
like a thunderstorm
he's crushing
down the noldor's
proudest king
under my foot
so hopeless it seems
you've troubled my day
now feel the pain
bridge
chorus
the elvenking's broken
he stumbles and falls
the most proud and most valiant
his spirit survives
praise our king
praise our king
praise our king
praise our king
awaiting my last breath
the mirror calls my name
it's showing me the way
into the dark
the bridge appears
i jump into the dark side
and hear the voice it's cold as ice
"welcome to reality"
where am i now?
darkness surrounds
can't go forward
can't go back
i see planets dying
i fall into the light
a new universe awakes

i can feel what's happening to me
and the mirrow will burst
chorus: x2
far, far beyond the island
we dwelt in shades of twilight
through dread and weary days
through grief and endless pain
it lies unknown
the land of mine
a hidden gate
to save us from the shadow fall
the lord of water spoke
in the silence
words of wisdom
i've seen the end of all
be aware the storm gets closer
mirror mirror on the wall
true hope lies beyond the coast
you're a damned kind can't you see
that the winds will change
mirror mirror on the wall
true hope lies beyond the coast
you're a damned kind can't you see
that tomorrows bears insanity
gone's the wisdom
of a thousand years
a world in fire and chains and fear
leads me to a place so far
deep down it lies my secret vision
i better keep it safe
shall i leave my friends alone
hidden in my twilight hall
i know the world is lost in fire
sure there is no way to turn it
back to the old days
of bliss and cheerful laughter
we're lost in barren lands
caught in the running flames
alone
how shall we leave the lost road
time's getting short so follow me
a leader's task so clearly
to find a path out of the dark
mirror mirror on the wall
true hope lies beyond the coast
you're a damned kind can't you see
that the winds will change
mirror mirror on the wall
true hope lies beyond the coast
you're a damned kind can't you see
that the winds will change
even though
the storm calmed down
the bitter end
is just a matter of time
shall we dare the dragon
merciless he's poisoning our hearts
our hearts
how shall we leave the lost road
time's getting short so follow me
a leader's task so clearly
to find a path out of the dark
mirror mirror on the wall
true hope lies beyond the coast
you're a damned kind can't you see
that the winds will change
mirror mirror on the wall
true hope lies beyond the coast
you're a damned kind can't you see
that the winds will change
turn your head and see the fields of flames
he carries along
from a distant place
he's on his way
he'll bring decay
don't move along
'cause things they will go wrong
the end is getting closer day by day
in shades of grey
we're doomed to face the night
light's out of sight
since we've reached the point of no return
we pray for starlight we wait for the moon
the sky is empty
alone in the unknown
we're getting nowhere
we have been betrayed
by the wind and rain
the sacred hall's empty and cold
the sacrifice made
should not be done in vain
revenge will be taken by rome
we live a lie
under the dying moon
palefaced laughs doom
indulges in delight
it's getting out of hand
the final curtain will fall
hear my voice
there is no choice
there's no way out
you'll find out
we don't regret it
so many men have failed
but now he's gone
go out and get it
the madman's head it
shall be thyne
we don't regret it
that someone else dies hidden in disguise
go out and get it
orion's hound shines bright
don't you think it's time to stop the chase
around the ring
just stop running running
round the ring
don't you know that fate has been decided by the gods
feel the distance, distance
out of reach
welcome to the end
watch your step, cassandra
you may fall
as i've stumbled on the field
sister mine
death's a certain thing
find myself in darkest places
find myself drifting away
and the other world
the other world appears
find myself she dies in vain
i cannot be freed
i'm falling down
as time runs faster
moves towards disaster
the ferryman will wait for you
my dear
and then there was silence
just a voice from other world
like a leaf in an icy world
memories will fade
misty tales and poems lost
all the bliss and beauty will be gone
will my weary soul find release for a while
at the moment of death i will smile
it's the triumph of shame and disease
in the end iliad
raise my hands and praise the day
break the spell show me the way
in decay
the flame of troy will shine bright
the newborn child will carry ruin to the hall
the newborn's death would be a blessing to us all
good choice?
bad choice?
out of there
you've chosen misery
power and wisdom
you deny
bad choice
war is the only answer
when love will conquer fear
so the judgement's been made to the fairest
the graceful says badly he fails
warning
fear the heat of passion, father king
don't let him in
don't let her in
desire, lust, obsession
death they'll bring
we can't get out
once they are in
she's like the sunrise
outshines the moon at night
precious like starlight
she will bring in a murderous price
in darkness grows the seed of man's defeat
jealousy
i can clearly see the end now
i can clearly see the end now
i can clearly see the end now
the thread of life is spun
the coin's been placed below my tongue
never give up
never give in
be on our side
so we can win
never give up
never give in
be on our side
old moon's time is soon to come
nowhere to run
nowhere to hide
nothing to lose
like one we'll stand
we'll face the storm
created by a man
roar roar roar roar
troy troy troy troy
and as the lion
slaughters man
i am the wolf
and you're the lamb
hallowed troy will fall
round the walls
faith is shattered bodies fall
nowhere to run
nowhere to hide
nothing to lose
like one we'll stand
it's all for one and one for all
we live for will be wiped out
i feel that something's wrong
surprise, surprise they're gone
full moon your time goes by
and new moon's still kept our of sight
we live we die
misty tales and poems lost
all the bliss and beauty will be gone
will my weary soul find release for a while
at the moment of death i will smile
it's the triumph of shame and disease
in the end iliad
raise my hands and praise the day
break the spell show me the way
in decay
the flame of troy will shine bright
roam in darkness
spread the vision
we will be lost if you truly believe
troy in darkness
there's a cold emptiness in our hearts
that they've gone away
and won't come back
they'll tear down the wall to bring it in
they'll truly believe in the lie, lie, lie
with blossoms they'll welcome
the old foe
the vision's so clear
when day and dream unite
the end is near
you better be prepared
the nightmare shall be over now
there's nothing more to fear
come join in our singing
and dance with us now
the nightmare shall be over now
there's nothing more to fear
the war it is over forevermore
no hope
the blind leads the blind
carry on
though future's denied
mare or stallion
there's far more inside
we are in at the kill we'll cheerfully die
misty tales and poems lost
all the bliss and beauty will be gone
will my weary soul find release for a while
at the moment of death i will smile
it's the triumph of shame and disease
in the end iliad
raise my hands and praise the day
break the spell show me the way
in decay
the flame of troy will shine bright
holy light shines on
so the judgement's been made
we're condemned though the trial's far ahead
the crack of doom
father
your handsome son is heading home
heading home
still the wind blows
calm and silent
carries news from a distant shore
out of mind
can't get it
can't get it
out of me head
sorrow and defeat
in 1945 the year it came to be
their fate decided
many miles across the sea
they told them not to fear
they couldn't be prepared.
then came the day
that not a single soul was spared.
too late there's no escape
the trial has begun
down they fly
from out of the sky
feel the radiation burn!
the men of power
had nothing to fear.
when the finger hits the switch
they're far away from here.
down in their sanctuary
hiding in their lair.
the sorcerers of justice
will be waiting for them there.
too late there's no escape
the trial has begun
down they fly
from out of the sky
feel the radiation burn!
i saw the people running
through all my dreams.
i heard the soldiers crying,
mother nature screams.
i saw destruction falling
from out of the sky.
i heard the wise man calling
why?
in 1945 the year it came to be
their fate decided
many miles across the sea
they told them not to fear
they couldn't be prepared.
then came the day
that not a single soul was spared.
too late there's no escape
the trial has begun
down they fly
from out of the sky
feel the radiation burn!
to the gods of the north, i pray
and raise my cup for the fallen ones
then i cry
in valhalla they'll sing
rain
red blood keeps pouring down
come valkyries, join me on that final ride
here i lie bleeding
odin, i await thee
the battle rages on
new lines they're weaving
the future, the past and the present
they're one
reveal their mask
show me a way to survive
this bitter war
soon it will be over
he will be the one
we'll weave in
and terror will now rule these lands
when the battle is lost
and the slain ones are chosen
valkyries will guide us home
when the battle is lost
and the slain ones are chosen
valkyries will guide us home
destiny
a spinning wheel
the path of glory
round and round
come join us
on your final ride to asgard
let's move on fast
allfather waits
so let's heed the final call
for now
we leave this world behind
it's over
all glory to the brave
still blood will rain
through storm and fire
let war winds reign
it's the feast for the crows
follow the light the light
just follow the light the light
or fade away
soon it will be over
he will be the one
we'll weave in
and terror will now rule these lands
when the battle is lost
and the slain ones are chosen
valkyries will guide us home
when the battle is lost
and the slain ones are chosen
valkyries will guide us home
we'll keep on weaving
we're crushing through lines
with our battering swords
we're marching on
assign the brave
to survive
this bitter war
soon it will be over
he will be the one
we'll weave in
and terror will now rule these lands
when the battle is lost
and the slain ones are chosen
valkyries will guide us home
when the battle is lost
and the slain ones are chosen
valkyries will guide us home
we'll heed the final call
a call to arms
the valkyries will guide us home
the finally i hear them say
carry on
for valhalla awaits you
i can see a crow on your judgement day
seems like a sermon
please come over, don't come over
please come over here
welcome the last day of our lives
i will break the circle
walls, i'll tear them down
and guilt will break the silence
but there is no return
no return
we shall overcome
we will bring you back
to a moment in time
we will reveal and detect
what you are
precious truth in a cage
it has been captured but safe
and there we'll bind it and
blind it with lies
the king will come
world will come undone
he is the center of creation
the prophecy
it's a promise to us all
a crow, a storm
shadows will be rising soon
a crow, a storm
the nine sing
once upon a dream ago
we're the ones you've left alone
now, as we speak
there's a way, there's a door
come find us and join us
come see it and feel it
doors in and out
you shall be falling
your mind's still trapped in twilight
now, catch a glimpse
shall i get through
they've walked on
to the other side
but how could i know?
i'm drowning, drowning
where do i belong?
drown in shadows
i am the center of creation
the prophecy
it's a promise to us all
a crow, a storm
shadows will be rising soon
a crow, a storm
the nine sing
once upon a dream ago
we're the ones you've left alone
don't blame me, don't blame me
it's my lying toad
the crow and the hare
they've moved further into the unknown
mark my words
they will be gone
you'll see them playing games, my dear
they've moved along
cause one day in the afterlife
we'll meet again
they're frowning, frowning
on your judgement day
they are shadows
they're in the center of creation
the prophecy
it's a promise to us all
a crow, a storm
shadows will be rising soon
a crow, a storm
the nine sing
once upon a dream ago
we're the ones you've left alone
but don't be afraid
there's war beyond the red door
and please ignore their pleas
just break the seal
break the seal, find the red door
there's a red, there's a red, there's a red door
break the seal, find the red door
the eternal
the infernal
the eternal
we shall better get him back
the eternal
the infernal
the eternal
will we ever see the light again?
the hare once betrayed me and so did the fox and the crow
just once defied me
there's me and there's space where are they?
maybe dead no one knows
you can't defy me
ride all along with me
there's no tomorrow
now let me through
and wait for my command
don't try to be cruel
oh, my beautiful child
but how can you try to redeem the past?
it's not real as it seems now ride on your wave
and get back to that place
scratch deeper and deeper
and soon i will be on my own
the gods will ignore your end they'll defend the elder
the lords won't salute you
the saints they won't save you they'll defend their guardian
the savior won't heal your soul
caesar
no man's world it's the ides of march
then from the ashes of eternity
a new spirit will rise a new order shall take over
now raise the flag
the war seems over
and bow your head
at dawn they shall be murdered
woes, i will not complain
the further you get
the closer's the end, dear
but now
i will try
come and see
that things are not what they may seem
it's all written down
the savior lies bleeding
but he won't surrender
the scriptures don't lie
he'll e turned around
no one to blame
it all goes down
the gods will ignore your end they'll defend the elder
the lords won't salute you
the saints they won't save you
the savior won't heal your soul they'll defend their guardian
now go and get your holy grail
and don't forget
just once you'll cross the border
now let the saints the saints come marching in
whatever you'll do do it fast
my sweet son of decay
now let the saints the saints come marching in
transform you may pass rearrange it
now change to betray
i won't lie
while bright eyes are turning pale
your sands run low
your light shines
my last try
it'll soon be over
no sign shall be given for ages and more
you may enter first
but from now you will be on your own
the gods will ignore your end they'll defend the elder
the lords won't salute you
the saints they won't save you they'll defend their guardian
the savior won't heal your soul
you're getting your grail
but there's no place to go
longing for a new shore
eastern winds they blow cold
the saints you will bring them down
the savior won't take the crown
let my spirit fly let it fly
how did i get here?
what will i find here?
i've come to meet
the evil one
i understand
there is no sense
the curse lives on
my children mourn
truth is a beast
with a sad face
a demon
the cruelest of all
forever
i'm wondering
who is it for?
there's nothing more
there is no door
no more lies
you won't enter
you will see
they've locked the secret place
out
and day won't come again
so there's no relief
when truth shall be revealed
by now you know the answer
so there's no relief
but revenge
abandoned, forgotten, deceived
wherever they may roam
so faithful, so loyal
still no one will come
you're alone
don't call it destiny
we will remember
skies may fade
and stars may wane
we won't forget
and your light shines bright
yes, so much brighter
shine one
we will remember
until the skies will fall
we won't forget
we will remember
we all shall follow doom
it's going down
going down
and there's nothing you can do
look into my eyes
and see
your seed
it may grow
this is no vision
it's the curse i set upon your kin
you'll be deceived
their cries shall come true
it shall be me
you blame
now watch and see
i'll set doom
upon you
your offspring shall bloom
wherever they may roam
i'll bind them
i'll split them
in solitude
sorrow shall grow
unknown
we will remember
skies may fade
and stars may wane
we won't forget
and your light shines bright
yes, so much brighter
shine on
we will remember
until the skies will fall
we won't forget
we will remember
we all shall follow doom
there is no choice
there's repentance
'cause nothing will grow here at all
redeem the oath
and pay the price
if you want
here on these fields
where truth shall be revealed
in doom you'll find the answers
still there's no release
you shall feel
let's face it
since everything's shown
you've been through this alone
the deeper the wounds
so much greater the sorrows will grow
there is no sense in it
we will remember
skies may fade
and stars may wane
we won't forget
and your light shines bright
yes, so much brighter
shine on
we will remember
until the skies will fall
we won't forget
we will remember
we all shall follow doom
we, together
change the world forever
what a cheerful sound
synchronize me
supervise me, mother
no more fooling around
whatever may come
it shall be from the ashes
he shall rise, i know
and though it hurts me
don't be surprised, dear mother
longing to see his end
don't call it
hopelessly insane
i go and grasp the grail
but in a graceful way
illegally, my aim
the grail will cross the border now
don't tell me that you're innocent
don't tell me it's divinely ordained by the saints
my demons, my saviors
i weep for all of them
suffered in vain
my wayward son, you might disturb me
carry the flame
till dying embers will stop gleaming
there on the battlefield she sings
praise, hallelujah
the holy grail's on its way now
magna eterna
magna eterna sings
your journey's over
the holy grail's on its way now
do as it's foreseen
come and meet the king
there's no choice
for the word it must be
real, my righteous brother
fear you soon will know
so, on the fourteenth day passover
he took the firstborn sons
execute him and now act as
judas, the chosen one
so after all, in vain
i've met him and found the grail
cause in a skillful way
i'll change to keep alive
eternal lie, i'll be the one
key to life, be the eclipse
voices from the river styx
come to be the nemesis
kiss of death
crucifix and the grail
i've traveled far on hidden pathways
the holy grail
who would have thought that i will hold it
the holy grail
there on the battlefield she sings
praise, hallelujah
the holy grail's on its way now
magna eterna
magna eterna sings
your journey's over
the holy grail's on its way now
don't tell me that you're innocent
don't tell me that there is a chance to be free
the grail's sent, my way ends
i creep along with the shadows
and resurrected
he comes marching in
there he is
good lord forgive my sins
once i've crossed the river styx
at sheol's gate, i know
key to the apocalypse
i have sealed it with a kiss
nothing that i want to do
hades is calling
wake the witch, who'll be the brave one?
don't say what he's like
full of voices comes the ninth wave
don't say what it's like
beyond the door
there on the battlefield she sings
praise, hallelujah
the holy grail's on its way now
magna eterna
magna eterna sings
your journey's over
the holy grail's on its way now
norns are howling
norns are prowling
let this game begin
watch, my children
watch me, you've all come to die
for this battle is lost
losing their minds
losing their souls hush, now hush
we don't talk
we don't care anymore i will seal every door
we don't care anymore
i summon the nine now
confirm the alignment can't get through?
carry on, you fools
try to break free
when we fail
it's lost forever oh
when we fail
it's lost forever oh
it's not real, no reason to be here
no more fear and no more regrets
don't look back and free your mind
stay where you are till the sealing is over
say goodbye, my friend
here's your promised end
be a part of the grand parade
along we're driven
on and on, it's a grand parade
we're one, we're so sorry to say
it's all the same, you will see
on this grand parade
damnation
now join the grand parade
don't be upset i will seal every door
every now and then seal every door
they'll try to awake the misguided i will seal every door
the voices you'll hear
they will claim to be real, it's not true
now look around
we will bring them down
the more i'll show
the less you will know
the nine will frown
now see how it grows
secretly my vision comes true
it's not real
you'll hear it, you'll see it
the otherworld
the otherworld
the otherworld appears
now round and round
we all shall lose ground
now praise, i'm the one
we will never fear
we will never fear
we will never fear them again
oh and here comes the son, the son
he's gone with the shadows
along with the stars
no more gods, no more lies
no more gods, no war
we'll be free here, we are one
our will is strong
no more lies and no more tyrants
it all becomes real when the sealing is over
say goodbye, my friend
here's your promised end
be a part of the grand parade
along we're driven
on and on, it's a grand parade
we're one, we're so sorry to say
it's all the same, you will see
on this grand parade
damnation
now join the grand parade
there is no return
it would be the end
we shall sing, we shall sing
praise the day
void, we don't fear you no more
mother void, you can't enter no more
we don't need any hallows
we don't fear any shadows
shadows on the wall
they're not real
now, walk in, everyone
here comes the sun
we will never fall
we will never fall
we will never see him again
many, we're one
we're humanized
the time has come
this flesh is truth
this blood is real
the highest cause
it's all that we are longing for
there on the river styx
you'll see, my friend
there on the river styx
you'll see
they've fooled you to take it away
so no more myths
no more bliss
we are holding it in our hand
and there is nothing they can do
and so this battle ends forevermore
we don't fear anything
nor any other race
we take control
no longer we act like fools
we're in control
say goodbye, my friend
here's your promised end
be a part of the grand parade
along we're driven
on and on, it's a grand parade
we're one, we're so sorry to say
it's all the same, you will see
on this grand parade
damnation
now join the grand parade
drown one more time
while we all will say goodbye
bright, it shines bright
let us carry one the lie
no more lies
one more lie
as dark night embraces
we are the nation
i will cleanse all your thoughts
we will cleanse them all
now, my children
for the sake of our nation
let us carry on
in glory
when dark night embraces
we are the nation
be my fellowmen
we will wipe them out
let there be light
for the sake of our nation
precious and bright
when dark night embraces my mind
a twisted plan
after all
despite all burden
life has grown
and though the curse is still alive
file 664
the golden age's vanished and more
the ingenious knight knows it's over
he no longer denies there's a real me
he'll be disgraced
burnt and sealed
they may end
as we will rule the world
defeat the dying old crow
let this fire burn
sail on till you reach the promised land
we all drown in the fifth dimension
the ninth wave
i can feel it's coming
the ninth wave
sail on till you reach the promised land
we all wait for a new tomorrow
we'll bring a new age
along with the final wave
the final wave
we will rise
burn them all, bring the damned
there's a price to pay
burn them all, bring the damned
do as i command
our praise and triumph will grow
we'll defy the nine
delete the dying old crow
to muriel's fire, walk with me
down to the abaddon
will you walk with me to the sheol?
good or bad we all meet the abaddon
take a look and you see it's all the same
imaginations
exterminate them
imaginations
exterminate them
an evil revelation
a wicked thought
denied by their savior
they all prayed for
salvation
there are no gods
so no one can save them
until
they will redeem belial
they will unite them all
then many men will fall
when they will heed the call
so they'll be free
before the final curtain falls
belial
bring the cursed
bring the damned
as we will rule the world
they'll seek the dying old crow
let this fire burn
sail on till you reach the promised land
we all drown in the fifth dimension
the ninth wave
i can feel it's coming
the ninth wave
sail on till you reach the promised land
we all wait for a new tomorrow
we'll bring a new age
reborn as aeon gods
as aeon gods
we'll break through
further down you'll walk with me
down to seal avalon
will you walk with me to the fire?
further down we come to seal avalon
take a look and you see it's all the same
imaginations
exterminate them
imaginations
exterminate them
there is no real salvation
we will wipe them out
and nothing remains here
as we don't need salvation
we will not fade
forever we'll stay here
screams come from the inside
the king is gone, but
this war is not over
burnt and sealed they may end
as we will rule the world
delete the dying old crow
let this fire burn
sail on till you reach the promised land
we all drown in the fifth dimension
the ninth wave
i can feel it's coming
the ninth wave
sail on till you reach the promised land
we all wait for a new tomorrow
we'll bring a new age
reborn as aeon gods
as aeon gods
we'll break through
could not break the silence
could not move in here
how can they stay so silent?
all the grief and violence
for all they went through
for all it breaks loose
it's bursting out
fire, walk with me
fire, walk with me
the will is strong
can i show you fear?
don't move
don't turn
don't come too close as i
burn down this place
my spirit will set it all on fire
would you like to meet the tyrant in the twilight zone?
get in, don't be late
and breathe in my reality
but first break the silence
there is more
beyond the dawn he's rising
where darkness grows
he traveling in disguise
now don't look back
now you know why
we set sail to new shores
we will meet him
sacred mind
we build a new pleasuredome here
xanadu
my xanadu
my xanadu
don't look back, just enter
what i call my soul asylum
where they are playing tricks
everybody
if you like to see
whatever lies beyond that golden door
it seems
my frequency's turned weak
try to remember me
try to remember me
then for a while
we've heard the sounds of sirens
you turn to stone
medusa's in your sight
i tell you why
rearranged by the ages gone by
you can change it
sacred mind
we build a new pleasuredome here
xanadu
my xanadu
my xanadu
sacred mind
we build a new pleasuredome here
xanadu
my xanadu
my xanadu
chance or predestined end
praise, hallelujah
never mind the end
fool the mall
fear the demon in disguise
keep your secret inside
let's move on, it's time
a thousand years gone by
the pleasuredome
what will we hear
and what will we see
all a lie
there's no boat
there's no river
no shore
journey's over
sacred mind
we build a new pleasuredome here
xanadu
my xanadu
my xanadu
when they are coming
give us guidance
for they are calling
to erase the damned
yet, after all they praise the coming
to erase the damned
they will return
now let me take you to the other side
turn off the light and let it grow
they will set it on fire
they come to fool us all
they are slaves to the fire, you know
their fire must grow
they have to feed it
we must believe in something
that i would call a miracle
the grail will break the final seal
we must believe in something
a miracle, a miracle machine
we just hide it secretly
no belief, no belief, no belief
give us what we need
betrayed by the nine
i've learned to love the shadows
and now they're coming home
that's why i need you on the other side
and then we, we may carry another light
i summon from the inside, deeper insight
they don't belong here
though they claim they're right
let it grow
turn off the light
let reason grow
they will set it on fire
they come to fool us all
they are slaves to the fire, you know
their fire must grow
they have to feed it
we must believe in something
that i would call a miracle
the grail will break the final seal
we must believe in something
a miracle, a miracle machine
we just hide it secretly
for they are coming
give us guidance
i step from door to door
my mind's misguided
keep moving on and on forevermore
was it real what i saw in the mirror?
was it fear when the end got clearer?
now as my time's passing by
what am i waiting for?
who'll grant me wings to fly?
and will i have another try?
'cause i would not miss my moment again
yes, i would not miss this moment my friend
no one knows the answer
what could have been
the edge i still fear
the roads they're leading nowhere
there is no end
oh gods be with me
carry me along
in blindness i tried to march on
mystified me
yes, it fooled me
no surrender
don't surrender
i hear them calling
i hear them calling
can hear them scream
don't be late when aeons pass
your memories will fade
even the purest one might fail
here and deceive
the righteous soul
and then their world will come undone
they burn, they bleed
till the savior will break through
in between the realms they're gathered
and from the edge of time
once more they return, they will save us all
now break through
recall the eclipse
there is none who survive
defeat, defeat, defeat
there's no more
you've searched for the answer
the answer is creed
they're real no more
you cannot get over
my light shall shine forever
the nine beyond the wall
they're turning
they're burning
they now understand
i soon will seal all doors
their stars won't shine here anymore
their savior won't even try
he can't remember the truth
my words become real
and there's nothing they can do
they may follow a plan they once had
deeply sad
they have chosen the wrong side and tried to resist
all their visions and music no longer exist
when the morrow will come it shall all be
in between the realms, in between the realms they might move on
that's when all pureness dies in vain
there's no release
the infernal lord has won
and forevermore
yes, forevermore
they burn, they bleed
till the savior will break through
in between the realms they're gathered
and from the edge of time
once they return they will save us all
now break through
will i
yes, will i fail to believe, my friend?
what if it's all done in vain?
don't be afraid
will it be me they blame?
see, it's a whole world that i've once condemned
and i shattered it all with a thought as it seems
but it all has been me as the mirror has revealed
now reveal
now redeem
i will carry the storm the savior's coming home
yes, i'll carry the grail and i'll wash away the pain
there's no release
the infernal lord has won
and forevermore
yes, forevermore
they burn, they bleed
till the savior will break through
in between the realms they're gathered
and from the edge of time
once they return they will save us all
now break through
i don't look back
there's more in me
my hour shall come
the old gods are calling
then straight ahead
a door appears
the tyrant must go down
that's when the ancient gods return they will return
get him off the throne
moreover he's not in control no longer
the king will come, it's over
the game goes on
someone's waiting on the other side
trying to get over
got to be in this hour
there on the other side
we know that someone keeps waiting
don't you know your enemy?
don't you know you're damned?
release the beast
set it free
i've come to tell you once more
don't let him break this seal
but let me tell you once more
peace shall come
we must serve the fire
we must confess we are liars
there must be something in the end
we're the curse got to feed it we must serve the fire
determination, determination
for all must burn down in the end we must serve the fire
it's because we are evil we must serve the fire
give us shelter from the storm
give us hope
give us shelter from the storm
give us hope
curse the wind a storm from the north
comes to divide us
will deny us
to break your king
these were dark lands in a dead world rearranged
we brought it into light a union of the land and king
it's a new world it is new land
but it ends here in the here and now
another failure once again
we will not believe in any word you may say
we will not believe in any word you may say
now we can see the enemy
i've come to tell you once more
it's me, i hold the key
but let me tell you once more
peace shall come
we must serve the fire we must confess we are liars
there must be something in the end
we're the curse got to feed it we must serve the fire
determination, determination
for all must burn down in the end we must serve the fire
it's a curse we are all bound we must serve the fire
curse them all they'll tear down the wall
come to divide us
they'll defy us
take my throne, all i am is nothing else what you have made me
nothing more i am your vision of another god
all i know is they won't give but they will take
your sacred light away
and still they come to praise the damned
can't you see?
it's your innocence they'll steal away
yes, they're coming for you
they've come to deceive
you are betrayed you admire these liars, they'll never fool me
we will not surrender
we won't take it no more
we will not surrender
we won't take it anymore
we'll break the seal and set 'em free
i've come to tell you once more
as i will now reveal
but let me tell you once more
peace is gone
we must serve the fire we must confess we are liars
there must be something in the end
we're the curse got to feed it
we must serve the fire
determination, determination
for all must burn down in the end we must serve the fire
it's a curse we are all bound we must serve the fire
determination blame the light
determination day and night
determination black and white
take a look at yourself determination
there is nothing to fear no more determination
there is nothing to fear no more determination
now, storm, come closer
can feel you're getting near
just stay invisible
'till it's over
chorus:
but still they don't know
they're just caught in distant memories
then these fools will fade away
they may not fear the fall
they won't be anymore
i hear their silent singing
"we don't fear anymore,
we don't fear him"
now don't come closer
stand still, don't interfere
don't move or things go wrong
we're trapped in twilight
trapped in the mind of
a sacrificial king
and the sun won't shine here anymore
"i curse the crow,
dear old friend"
and when the time is right for changes
we will salute you
and the new age may begin
chorus
when all the magic is gone
no need to carry it along
whatever the cost
it will not be redeemed
and whatever may come
it will not bring relief
in the mirror
they may fail to see
what is real behind
there it ends
and there is no return
they will go down
they all will have to drown
out of the dark
into the grey
these fools will fade away
no matter what
i've come to say
these fools will fade away
a storm comes closer
can feel you're getting near?
just stay invisible, you're no savior
chorus
i know they reach out for someone
reach out for the great unknown
chorus
they've thought it is time for changes
background "we will salute you" x3
moved on to the promised land
now let it begin
they've found a new god...
how've they dared to be
such misguided creatures
how've they dared to be
of such evil nature
spiral up to doors all sealed
no turning back
red door to discordia
steal the stars
deceive the day
a sign of evil
they're gone with a final warning
witness the twilight of the gods
will they ever return
a storm will take us
and then wipe us out
there's no retreat
we're trapped in twilight
while the gods will drowse
gods will drowse
they'll wait and sleep
until a new dawn'll save us from the dark
the damage's done
the king is gone
there is war
wherever i'll roam
gods will come and
gods will go
the spinning wheel keeps turning
now get up
lay down your ancient faith
we're the chosen ones
come feel the change
a way
let me show a new way
when you dare to walk with me
bow down
and surrender
the old gods
black or white
to me it's grey
a sign of evil
i hail all these nonbelievers
witness the twilight of the gods
will they ever return
a storm will take us
and then wipe us out
there's no retreat
we're trapped in twilight
while the gods will drowse
gods will drowse
they'll wait and sleep
until a new dawn'll save us from the dark
deliver your gods
they shall be slain
i'm their fallen son
don't be afraid
a way
let me show a new way
when you're going to walk with me
as one
we're infernal
what's going up
it will come down
we're here to change
there's war in discordia
sure as death
we all must fade
a sign of evil
now reach for a new horizon
witness the twilight of the gods
will they ever return
a storm will take us
and then wipe us out
there's no retreat
we're trapped in twilight
while the gods will drowse
gods will drowse
they'll wait and sleep
until a new dawn'll save us from the dark
a seed of doubt
it exists and it grows
a glimpse of life from somewhere deep within
awake and understand
is there anyone else here?
somebody screaming, please help me
find out now that i am not dreaming
welcome to my damnation, here it comes the real me
i didn't know, i couldn't hear the answer
my mind was blank, i should have known
hold it back but somehow
there is someone else, another stranger me, another stranger me
that's when the ice will break away
i can't get out here, anymore
'cause none of my keys fit the door
there's fear and anger, hate and love
i must confess, it's out of hand
it's cynic, it's cynic
still cynic, all my laughter
it's cynic, just manic
it's cynic, all her laughter
if there's anyone in, it soon will be over
we'll burn out, soul's aflame
we're on our own now, give up you cruel invasion
you're insane, i'll show you
i didn't know, i couldn't hear the answer
my mind was blank, i should have known
hold it back but somehow
there is someone else, another stranger me
out and gone, can't resist
cold and sore, the bolt of pain
keeps ripping through my head
i can take no more
don't tell anyone else but i do not believe her
she hates me, cloud my mind
she's a deceiver, i can feel cruel vibrations
would you like to meet me?
i didn't know, i couldn't hear the answer
my mind was blank, i should have known
hold it back but somehow
there is someone else, another stranger me
another stranger me
out on the water
the island of the dead that live
there they dwelt
until they left the world and
still their deeds live forth in songs
is it really the treasure of gold
or the dance on the rainbow itself
bound to a track
painting over the cracks
in his dreams they'd put up on the shelf
little windup soldier
with a ball and a chain
got destinations engraved on your mind
now you don't care as long
as you don't make it there
you wanna fly but not arrive
calling you, calling you
you are the one to hear them
calling you, calling you
calling you, calling you
and you daddy won't approve
and when no one's awake anymore
he paints a picture of a strange looking fly
from a distant world
you light it and lo and behold
it's coming alive
calling you, calling you
you always hear them speak
derringdo, derringdo
calling you, calling you
from a distant burning star
chorus
you wanna fly so you drag on flies
drag on dragonflies
from a suffocating room on a dragonfly
you're riding high when you nasalize
what you pulverize
make your day and dream away on a dragonfly
mayday mayday
i ain't fond of smoking
the buzzer knows in dire straits
selfless without intention
too late to intermediate
smoking kills
calling you, calling you
you are the one two three four
calling you, calling you
calling you, calling you
and your daddy don't approve
chorus x4
we're getting high on a dragonfly
when the lights go down you feel it come alive
driven by the dread of love that never passes by
when the night unfolds a veil across the day
waiting for the flood to come to wash the stains away
look at the clouded sky
poisoned rain, angels cry
cracks show in the seal
tonight a thousand angels fall
heaven's up against the world
changes holding sway
we can make you anyone
by the morning we'll be gone
the ministry of saints
you're afraid to disappear beneath the waves
bread and circus, bread and wine
they rain on your parade
round and round and round
you're spinning like a wheel
crying for redemption you break the seventh seal
we're cleansing your soul from sin
plead for you, angels sing
we're taking pride of place
tonight a thousand angels fall
heaven's up against the world
and change is holding sway
we can make you anyone
by the morning we'll be gone
the ministry of saints
tonight a thousand angels fall
heaven's up against the world
and change is holding sway
we can make you anyone
by the morning we'll be gone
the ministry of saints
walking a lonely road in the dark
a scent of rain
under wings of a clouded sky
is it a losing game
running after pictures
slowly slipping away
trying to take hold of a memory
do you remember the days when forever
had only just begun
you reach for the distance
and when you arrive the distance is gone
already gone
withered roses in the rear view mirror
fade away and rain came late
was it all worth it
when it's all been proven just an illusion
a distant memory for
tomorrow in the palm of our hands
what's gonna be left but a thorn without roses
tomorrow in the palm of our hands
we're gonna take hold of a thorn
of a thorn without a rose
laid out a hedge of thorns around my heart
pricking your fingers
our reasons and soul
tearing you and me apart
bed of roses in the rear view mirror
it turns to thorns
to a bed of thorns
i'd never known that dying embers
would hurt more than the blazing fire we'd lit
tomorrow in the palm of our hands
what's gonna be left but a thorn without roses
tomorrow in the palm of our hands
we're gonna take hold of a thorn without a rose
why do you think that you have lost
there ain't nobody who has not
it ain't right what i feel
i'll been begging on my knees
for the sun to rise again  yeah
four yours and mine
another time
tomorrow in the palm of our hands
what's gonna be left but a thorn without roses
tomorrow in the palm of our hands
we're gonna take hold of a thorn without a rose
tomorrow in the palm of our hands
what's gonna be left but a thorn without roses
tomorrow in the palm of our hands
we're gonna take hold of a thorn without a rose
silence  it ain't the kill but the thrill of the chase
same old story, same old song
only the names have changed
fair warning  i could have read your mind in time
by the look in your eyes
like diamonds turning to ashes
ties frayed and i missed your signs
now i can't get over you
cannot get under somebody else
i close my eyes
chorus:
when all i see is you, you came to drain my love away
but it takes nine lives till it's over
all i see is you, you came to drain my life away
but i got nine, i got nine lives till it's over
all my supplications gone unheard
your head in my crotch has turned to a boot
but you won't hear a word
salvation  i ride into nowhere and out of nowhere i'll come
the twinges in your brain, the pang of regret
don't mess with no son of a gun
i'm gonna get over this
gotta get under somebody else
i close my eyes
chorus:
when all i see is you, you came to drain my love away
but it takes nine lives till it's over
all i see is you, you came to drain my life away
but i got nine, i got nine lives
all i see is you, you came to drain my love away
but it takes nine lives till it's over
all i see is you, you came to drain my life away
i got nine lives till it's over
till it's over i got nine lives, i got nine lives
we opened the door after midnight
to step into a timeless world
angels and madness been flying around
a crack in the voice of reason
something has taken over
preventing us from turning around
been sailing across the seas
we never arrived but always believed
and now for the first time time i feel
the port i was too blind to see
929  just a number at sundown
a room with a view
929  a night to remember
929  i been reaching out
i been stumbling around
929  i'm finally home
been standing there with a suitcase
surroundings fighting to get out
send it off to the lostandneverfound
maybe i don't have my head on straight
maybe i'll lose it tomorrow
preventing me from turning around
been sailing across the seas
up in the wind
plowing through grief
and now for the first time i see
the port i was too blind to see
929  a number at sundown
a room with a view
929  a night to remember
929  i been reaching out
i been stumbling around
929  i'm finally home
welcome to this wonderworld
everybody take your sledges
winterland plutocracy
down the slope don't fear the hedges
everybody in their box
waiting under rights of action
raise your heads and hold your breath
i can't stand your putrefaction
i can smell your brain decay
as you look down at the stage and
drive me mad and then insane
welcome to the show
you've been waiting for the one
to bring you joy and ecstasy
and you've been waiting for a song
and you demand to feel the tragedy
but when it's right out of control
and it's not your song anymore
and you are ready to forget
the truth that you'd been asking for
i'm not afraid to sacrifice
and i don't care bout your advice
as i spread my wings and fly
no love  it's pain you've come to feed
in mental strain i crawl and bleed
you make me please
forever roaming
you will hear it scream
the cries of speedhoven
forever roaming
every starless night
you will hear the cries
you'll never get:
i'll never be the one that you want me to be
and all the treasures that you hold
all your diamond rings and gold
all your flake and look and tongue
i have tried and it was wrong
you tried to push me up a notch
but all i made was an itchy crotch
fornication, ass galore
i wanted love and i want more
muckrakers waiting for the prey
muckrakers want me to obey
but you will never own me
though you pay
this opera is haunted they will say
that's where they've driven the light insane
forever roaming
you will hear it scream
the cries of speedhoven
forever roaming
every starless night
you will hear the cries
forever roaming
you will hear it scream
the cries of speedhoven
forever you'll hear it scream
in a cold winter night i had a vision
taking me by my hand
leading me to the door
to rescue me from the wastelands
the glance of the shining ivories
a world that they can't understand
out of sound, out of reason
the voice of their laughter was gone
taken away, time for a change
i'm walking over
flying away, flying away
dying into another world
pure and divine
and the laughter dies
welcome to this wonderworld
everybody take your sledges
winterland plutocracy
down the slope don't fear the hedges
forever roaming
you will hear it scream
the cries of speedhoven
forever roaming...
i can't figure the lord down in funereal gravity
one finishing touch and the creature is coming alive
as i kneel down and pray
i know god is watching over me
is he's knocking me out of my stride
and on day number eight
when the sun is about to go down
here we go, what a show
what a nose for blow
you're alive said the maker and smiled at the aardvark
you're divine by the grace of the master above
you're alive said the maker and smiled at the aardvark
you're divine by the grace of the master above
hey frankenstein are you the one i think you are
godfather. if were divine you are bizarre
i hear you laughing from the lodge above
at my expense for your entertainment
hey lord above why don't your armies ever smile?
godfather. why don't they ever dress in style
and never share the humor that you surely have
creating me for your entertainment
why do they have to get married before they do what they do?
everyday anyway, when there's hell to pay
you're alive said the maker and smiled at the aardvark
you're divine by the grace of the master above
you're alive said the maker and smiled at the aardvark
you're divine by the grace of the master above
we fold our hands, afraid of what we've done
fear is the key, you're thy kingdom come
you shake your head and have another wine
don't you almost die laughing wondering why
running in the dust, running in the dust
afraid of the hail stones
cold as ice
running in the dust, running in the dust
straight to the wastelands
well never read your signs
running in the dust, running in the dust
afraid of tomorrow
afraid of what we've done
running in the dust, running in the dust
you're the disciples of the big bad wolf or what
you're alive said the maker and smiled at the aardvark
you're divine by the grace of the master above
you're alive said the maker and smiled at the aardvark
you're divine by the grace of the master above
you're alive, oh you're alive
you're alive, the pride of creation
oh you're the pride of creation, yes you are
oh you're the pride of creation, yes you are
lyrics to dead or rock :
no rules, no pain, no fear and no reason
full moon, we're insane
twotime and one big treason
there is fire in the air tonight
a wicked sensation
stick waving, dick waving
trialrun of procreation
lady don't leave us in a mess
take the bow and shove it up your ass
go die or rock tonight
no tradeoff  there's just dead or rock
your house on fire tonight
no tradeoff  there's just dead or rock
she reigns and goes down, your muse in prudery
encaged, enslaved, depraved and shaved
austerity
we're caviar to the general
beyond your sight
rape your imagination
kicking up a row tonight
oh we have come to make a mess
kiss the baton and then shove it up your ass
go die or rock tonight
no tradeoff  there's just dead or rock
your house on fire tonight
no tradeoff there's just dead or rock
expert on art: aristocratic, uptight and pathetic
don't need no sympathy
don't need to play by the rules
go down in ecstasy, go down on you
go die or rock tonight...
this one is for our troops
who beat the shit
out of bad people
and their families
aren't you a little pervert too
just a little handcuff doesn't do
beat the bullet, push and pull it
till the crotch is black and blue
aren't i a little pervert too
aren't you a little pervert too
think the seventh orifice will do
you're the socket for the rocket
in my pocket dododoooo
i know you're a little pervert too
there's a million different ways to get off
i have seen it on tv in tokyo
in finland and australia
not so much in america
americans prefer the rodeo
aren't you a little pervert too
dream of what a whip can do to you
all your lipstick on my dipstick
as you scream like a baboon
aren't you a little pervert too
aren't you a little pervert too
getting off waiting at the loo
for the hour the golden shower
is being spilled all over you
i know honey that you want it too
let me spill my love all over you
i know you're a little pervert too
music & lyrics: tobias sammet
you gotta know
that there ain't always
words of reason to explain
with those words my heart is falling silent
to let me slowly go insane
god tell me why your voice ran dry
and left me dreaming black
chorus:
dying angels, dying angels
feeling takes a gun to fire
reason from a lightening sky
dying angels, dying angels
i'm agonizing over dreams
strangled by a feeling
i wake up dreaming black
a million single islands drift apart
and i'm losing ground
the more i feel the less i know
straitjackethero inward bound
god tell me why your voice ran dry
and left me dreaming black
chorus 2x
i wake up dreaming
another hero  a dying hero
another hero  a dying hero
hey there pal won't you gimme an ear
gimme your everything and keep your fear
godly voices telling me what to do
they're out for palpitation
then leave you to your desperation
take you and tie you run over you
there's no resistance to the cry of the sirens
calling you  a razor edge affair
you close your eyes boy
she tears your lids in two
never even try to miss she's there
and then when the time pieces shatter
i am baptized by the attar
right into heavens door
sex fire religion
visionary position
angel in your temple of pleasure
sex fire religion
i been granted admission
angel in your temple of love
wicked wild ma'am with a bag full of tricks
and up shit creek there i'm stuck in a fix
strikes like a bolt from the blue
the siren baits with lubrication
then she steals your habitation
rides you and ties you and runs you
maybe she don't know love
but she knows how to make it
divinity is running down her skin
in the city of evil we touch the sky
let the ride to paradise begin
and when the time pieces shatter
i am baptized by the attar
kick down into the pie
sex fire religion
visionary position
angel in your temple of pleasure
sex fire religion
i been granted admission
angel in your temple of love
sex fire religion

angel in your temple of pleasure

jeer at him moving in slowmo surrounded
by a spiritentourage so oddinviting sneer
you ride the spinning wheel that's getting faster
outside they saw the passing centuries
round and round merry go round
round and round you go
scream and shout laugh aloud
it's so out of vogue
to lead a way outside the catalogue,you're in vogue
and don't understand
it's so out of vogue to contradict
your transient mistress of the world
how does it feel in your cage
trapped in vogue?
so don't you miss a thing in your carrousel
you feel so proud behind the steering wheel
the mind you sold waves at you from outside
and you feel happy as you kneel
lady dark crack the whip300 pounds of lust
one shall get what you nedd..
it's so out of vogue
how do you do inside the catalogue?
you're in vogue and don't miss a thing...
what do you think when you spit in my face?
how does it feel to accuse and to haze?
now look at me, i'm not one of your kind,
and i prefer to stay behind.
and walk the wicked way!
we don't wanna be like you,
don't you get the king of fools?
we don't mind your life is trite,
you are the king of fools.
we are never gonna be like you,
we don't follow  king of fools,
you're the blind who lead the blind.
and walk the wicked way!
you feel at ease as you flock with the masses,
what do you see with your heads in their asses?
keep on railing at what i believe ,
call me insane and i am proud to be.
and i walk the wicked way!
we don't wanna be like you,
don't you get the king of fools,
we don't mind your life is trite,
you are the king of fools.
we are never gonna be like you,
we don't follow  king of fools,
you are the blind who lead the blind!
 guitar solo 
we don't wanna be like you,
don't you get that king of fools?
we don't mind your life is trite,
you are the king of fools!
we are never gonna be like you,
we don't follow  king of fools,
you are the blind who lead the blind.
you are the king of fools!
soldier of sunlight
welcome to the kingdom of ignorance
where all the tears of ages tell their tales
no one dares to break the spell
no one dares to fly
time is running out you can't deny
how many times
have you found yourself under the influence?
how many times has a mirror mad you cry?
now it's time to stand upright
tear down your inner door
the birth of yourself can't wait no more
in your mind there's a battle raging on
try to find what you're fighting for
chorus
wake up the king
from his sleep in your fantasy
wake up the king
let him be all you ecstasy
tears flow to rivers
and rivers to oceans of broken dreams
have you ever heard of tears of joy?
show yourself a sense of life
open up your eyes
let your heartbeat be your best advice
in your eyes i can see the fire burn
realize, now it is your turn
chorus
look at the mountain, look at the sun
feel all the pure energy
birds fly and whisper, call out your name
they belong to you and you're the
king of a kingdom, light in your hand
look at what you have never seen
walk on a rainbow, look to the stars
cry it out and make your dream come true
chorus x 2
can't you see the crown?
...and the vision continued: "there is less sense in complaining than looking for your skills..."
in the eyes of the mighty domain and its evil
doctrines, there is no trace of romance
but the fears that grow
no one can watch his next into the eyes
you killed the poetry of mine
a long time ago  now
how many times have you given me rage
when your words were mendacious
and your laughter insane, how many times
have you written lampoons about my life
and desires, about my pleasure and pain
i bare my fangs to you, look at my face and
you'll stare into my mind and you'll watch
the eyes of the tyrant  eyes of the night
the eyes of the tyrant  eyes of the night
back from the hades, into the daylight
back from the hades, into the daylight
king of tonight, tell me what should i do
should i die in glory, should i raise my fist
the crime of my deads is the frolic i need
i won't die on my knees, i will kill to resist
the chagrin of the damned cries the tears of
romance, lord of uprightness take me now
the empire of the sad, the empire of the mad
my feelings were killed so long ago
yeah, we are eternal, we are immortal
there is a trace of glory in our hands
majestic and wild, we stand and we fight
soon your blackened pride will be fading away
you'll realize you'll had been walking astray
never tame the wicked, i'm a tyrant tonight
back from the hades, into the light
back from the hades into:
uh, now here we go
when you cross the edge inside
reach out for the stranger
as you sign the deal tonight
icarus's your only guide
see the haggard child of sun
to the tempting fires you run
pass the gate and realize
casting evil eyes
down at your dark lab
you threw some tarot cards
reading the fiery truth
alchemist you were right
the vision's alive
the devil and the savant
gaze away
far away
alchemist you're free
inside of your prison
the devil and the savant
take a light,
getting sight of a revelation forced:
the chemical wedding day...
he appears at your desire
does your bidding  always
lights the candle in the dark
see the blood  oh  of us all
think you force him to expose
all above and all below
you're never able to unveil
what you had to feel...
spoken:
"ladies and gentleman  welcome to the freakshow"
oh yeah...
the world around is killing me
no thunder wind and rain
eels are crawling everywhere
compounding with the game
grind the army, the living dead, without destination
the faceless crowd is out to kill all kinds of variations
you're trying to trample down my dreams
a shot in the dark
mysteria  the spirit arising
eldrich cries from the hill
mysteria  fires are blazing
their wicked feast is shattering the still oh
seven days and nights a week
spinning like a wheel
you try to buckle, band and break
and polish stainless steel
raging fury in the sky burning with desire
selfdetermination rising from the fire
you're trying to trample down my dreams
my disdained ideals
beware of the difference
we're savage and mean  we're a...
mysteria....
evil is the dreamer to pit himself
against the forces of the tide
you pay the see to portray
what you wanna hear what he has senn that night
oh  unholy is the feast
watch us dance around the the blazing hellfire
and lucifer arises he appears at my desire
mysteria...
road lies ahead
and a long road lies behind me
i see lights passing by
and i know it's the time of our lives
a million miles
lightyears i've been travelling
to watch and enjoy this wolrld
and i've seen ass galore
i'm musing over it all
closing my eyes to remember it all
embracing the past and the future to come
kiss the road that leads to my tribe..
i've found my way home
i'll return to where i belong
back to where i stem fromback to paradise
time to return to the tribe!
the other side  always close to the edge
been walking a thin line
always knew someone watched my step
a mistery to make it out alive and sane
the battle is over
and i know who's been with me..
now i'm musing over it all
on top of this world i remember it all
awaiting that sunrise and sunset at home
kiss the way that leads me to my tribe
i've found my way home...
i've seen battlefields, drunk drummers
japanese hotel toilets
piesel tuning guitars
and a.c. being my personal slave
back to the tribe!
i've found my way home
i'll return to where i belong
back to where i stem fromback to paradise
time to return to the tribe!
tribe!
i've found my way home
i'll return to where i belong
back to where i stem fromback to paradise
time to return to the tribe!
by tobias sammet
always tried so hard to leave a tragic story
it's tearing me apart you never really care
never met with your approval from your higher category
found life at killing pace and wanna have my share
i've been led to the water to lap up
so i'm not gonna dry out draining
chorus
king of the mountain
devil has taken my reason
i got spooks in the attic
we dance on the mountain
and pleasure replacing my reason
got spooks in the attic
i'm a family kind of man i've lately started number ten
too alien to find somebody home
hyper salivation  hyper ventilation
heading for the grail across the sea of lubrication
i'm out for it while rather on my own
don't you see all the water so get down
if you don't wanna dry out draining
chorus
there is no place for reason
taking to the crest
and you won't go down in history with reason
and that stand no reason
i see an angel, fed up and pale
you've been a sleeper
you have been getting stale my friend
time to leave the vale again
back on the runway you accerlate
get out of the tight spot and fly
take your chance tonight
i'll give you a ride tonight
and as the sun is gonna rise
i gonna make you come alive
you can fly, reach for the sky
it's the rise of the morning glory
scream and shout, cry it out loud
we are comming back to life
now open your eyes
witness the rise
rise of the morning glory
when you're next to me
you're gonna see:
waahooo...
everyday they're wounding your pride
try to break you
and make you let go
the dreams you once have had
they'll never understand
there is a bastion that won't ever fall
our passion, aour magic, our fire
let them run us down
i couldn't care less about
there is no time to waste
you better quicken up your pace
you can fly...
crying on the pyre, feelin' all so strange
when you took my mind to deteriorate, told
me that you like me, atrocious and deterrent
lies, you showed me how it is to suffer hate
celebrate my funeral, vultures on my corpse
ashes to ashes  me to hell, you think i could
be dug alive, but you never knew, you're just
too deaf to hear my forces yell
all your mind is full of hate, you hold the link
to seal my fate, i stare into the light
now you'll try to burn me, inquisition in our
time, but i'll tell you what i am
burning like a frozen candle
burning like a frozen candle
i can still remember when you called the reaper
told him how to unlock my door, sleepers
nights, evil dreams, faces in the window
voices that i've never heard before
music & lyrics: sammet
sun going down, she opens her eyes
it's dark in the belfry and cold
whispers of rain, wind in the sky
so long it's been all she's been told
dream child, you're all alone
roaming though the night
scream child, lost and ashamed
for all the tears you cry
you're a child in sadness
a chessboard nightmare to go
hear that silent symphony
calling you up to the shore and you'll see us
as we sail away, moonstruck and astray
we're fallen angels
we're the scary tale to scare your mind away
from fallen angels
solo: both
so many days wasted in haze
you're free, oh so free on their strings
illusions of life, they say you can fly
they laugh and they cut off your wings
night child, they give you steel
and make you believe that it's gold
lies child, all that you're told
is just what you shall know
when they 'know' we are evil
we're strangers
and danger and fire,
the dark and the light
we are eyes in the night
lost souls' they curse
for we've found it inside  oh
repeat chorus
solo: jens
ohhh, yeah...
solo: jensboth
when they say you're a fossil
when their eyes nail you to the cross
take their curse and join our way
welcome my frien on the ship of the damned  oh
repeat chorus
huh!
what do you think when you smile into my eyes
you say that you like me but i know that's one of your lies
my love is abused my compassion misused
cause i am too kind to despise, oh no
you hear me you see me and use me but you neglect
you like having me on your tail and show me your back
why do we praise an illusion of grace
i know the way to survive
standing to fight the love that misguides
the steel church is the savior of life
chorus
take me take me to a church that accepts my hate
take me take me to a church of steel on steel
take me take me to a world i can lose my grace
take me take me to a hell of steel on steel
maybe i'm evil but i take every chance
when i can get more there's no time to waste for romance
show me how to maltreat to lie and to cheat
to fight steel on steel
out of the light into the night
that is what i want to feel
much too long i really have been to kind
can't you tell me why could i be so blind
sacred, standing full of pride
spite in my brain causing you to fight
enchained, you pray to get a slave
rules with no sense, to dust you will decay
you left the empire of freedom
hallowed be my name
hallowed be my name
the god of creation you beg for damnation
you think you can serve me with hate
hallowed be my name
hallowed be my name
the god of creation you beg for damnation
you think you can serve me with hate
a scent of rain
a healing breeze
is blown into my face
to feel desire
and raise my head
to gaze at the sky
and watch the setting sun
breaking through
the darkened clouds
and i feel that i
am still alive and breathe
for all the world to see
you can bind my blood
but the spirit will remain
for all the world to see
no matter what you claim
the spirit will remain
they wanna see me down
on my wounded knees
wanna see me cry
but my eyes
have run out of tears
when there's nothing left to pay
just a little light of day
i got something
you can't take away
fly away
far away
deep inside
shetter for my spirit and my pride
for all the world to see
you can bind my blood
but the spirit will be free
forevermore...
awake by that dreams of you
being all alone in the night
coldness in my empty chamber
no one here holding me tight
i could take a masquerade
to show you i don't need to cry
but i can let my tears run away
to show you i'm as weak as a child
so many times you make me cry
but i got no reason to deny
because i'm here and still alive
chorus
when a hero cries, emotions arise
the tears in my face seem to be a trace of life
when a hero cries
it felt like heaven to me but it was nothing for you
you said that i should forget but it ran me through
and i still can't deny that you still make me cry
chorus
too much time to get lost in the maze
tell me, isn't that strange
you bleed to get there  you were ready
to be a bird in a golden cage
sweat is breaking on my brow
where's the freak to ease my pain
room is dark and big and empty
silence driving me insane
night has fallen  demons laughing
i'm waiting for the light of day
here's the land of milk and honey
there you got the price to pay
searching for shelter
riding the pendulum to paradise
as i'm reaching higher  what a pure desire
i'm swinging back towards the edge
and i drift away  killing sacrifice
here i go insane
what a price to pay  little sacrifice
i set off to heaven and found bedlam
there's a part of me that has not been sold
save me please embrace me hold me
kiss my bleeding soul
you can't see below the creature
that's pounding, sitting in my neck
if you'd see inside my head
you surely wouldn't turn your back on me
i'm looking for shelter
riding the pendulum to paradise
as i'm reaching higher  what a pure desire
i'm swinging back towards the abyss
and i drift away  killing sacrifice
here i go insane
what a price to pay  little sacrifice
i set off to heaven and found bedlam
nothing remains the same
but still i hear those voices
nothing remains the same
where am i gonna go is it my destination
or just a sick temptation
and i remember home when demons came
and i got swept away from me
yeah
in a world of hate pollution
we can't breathe anymore.
we've to leave and this time you,
the pawn, have won.
on our quest for nowhere island
we set off to the sea.
you call surrender what we call
a calm before the storm
pounding thoughts of home they make me know:
"i will return! i don't live my life for you,
it's too short to get burned.
stand upright and face the wind!"
time to go back where i belong
no one can prevent me from
raising towers in babylon.
you only can love me if you can convert me
to attitudes of your brain.
you blame us for doing things
that you don't know.
you tell me what you'd do if you were me but you are you and i am i
lucky you, but this time i say: "no!"
pounding thoughts of home they make me know: "i will return!".
i don't want to hurt you but you'll have to learn:
you are you and i am i!!!
oh
oh yeah
and like the vision of my urge to salvation told me,
i built up a tower to widen my horizon, whatever they might say
countless pointing fingers
a nameless crowd too swollen to analyse
takes a rise out of the stranger
don't know where he's come from
bumfuck raises birds of paradise
they surmise very wise
one night they witnessed
how he lit his backdoor winds
fire turned the night into day
and they prayed, fell on their knees
and turned their glances off his face,
and they knew they have been chosen to obey
pardon me
raise a graven image
i'm the new messiah for the world
you can't see the splendor of my nimbus
but i'm the new messiah for the world
but i'm the new messiah for the blind
for the blind
the word shall spread like wildfire
here you got a new messiah holding sway
delightful game
don't you give away: i'm no redeemer
but bring me grapes and diamonds right away
and a maid to lay...
one day oblivion will swallow up my fame
the common run of mankind will forget my name
forget my name
like a phoenix rising someone else is gonna reign
till then you know that you are to obey me
pardon me...
gluttony and extasy, there's velvet on my dais
lions, ladies, rotaries they never spare with praise
a million pointing fingers
have turned to clapping hands
now i'm off to betty ford,
see you in hell my friends
pardon fucking me, who the fucking fuck is jesus
i'm the motherfucking new messiah
for the fucking world :
pardon me...
living in a screenplay she neve r read the end
and no one else is to see..
the pain of abrasions covered with a smile
no one's to look underneath
in a lonesome night she ran
away in quest for light and then
she found fire....
flying on broken wings
uprising from the ruins
living on broken dreams
what a night to come alive
living on broken wings
what a blessing in disguise
a blessing in disguise
you're a star in a comedy
never proofread by yourself
so that wicked sense of humour is divine?
and the cries of a bleeding child
may become a vow..
nevermore you'll fall into line
every long cold night you dreamoh
rain on you pain on you scream
your desire
flying on broken wings
uprising from the ruins
living on broken dreams
what a night to come alive
living on broken wings
what a blessing in disguise..
a blessing in disguise

flying...
music & lyrics: sammet
strong on your feet, you were blinded
building up a towar on shaking ground
once in a world full of colors
back to see just ruins there to be found
and now you're falling, crawling
diggin in the broken remains
of what had to be taken for strong
slowly it's been fading away
come into the painting on the wall
so the joker smiles
come into the painting on the wall
no more crying
illusions let you in from the rain
follow mr. hopkins, get insane
stories are told  wanna hear him
talking from the picture to your head
follow the call of a puppet
led into a black room painted red
where life is painless, brainless
you don't think of broken remains
of what had to be taken for strong
slowly it's been fading away

look at the picture

this is my day, soldiers are coming to take me away
may justice be done
i hold on to pray but no god seems to hear me
the pain i will face is my price for disgrace
for things that i've never done
the toll of the bell and the flight of the raven
they open my cell and i feel it's too late
there's no need to yell they don't want to hear me
the morning has come
it seems like my work's been done.
today i'll be the one
sometimes it's good to be schizophrene
cause when i'm close to the end i've got always a friend
on my lonesome way to the final decay
i listen to a voice telling me
chorus
now dream away, follow me astray
to a world that we can reach on wings of a dream
repeat
i've got the key to the end of the nightmare
to leave all the dreams of bane and despair
the life i redeem has got the price of insanity
that you just can't get cause you're not even mad
you only trust in your eyes
once upon a time there was a noble man like me
he only cared about the things he saw
one dark night without a moon he loved
the dog of his queen
thinking it was her he enjoyed the life in the raw
repeat
poor artist went to label, truckloads of money in mind
rich artist left the buildings
cause all the labels had been standing in line
and so they signed
artist wrote rock'n roll history
concentrated on a album so strong
but business claimed limited editions
insisting on a additional songs
that was the time when i had been born
when i first saw the light of day
and even if you got a different opinion
from my point of view  needless to say 
that i'm happy to be
ever if you don't want me to be
the world wouldn't go round without me
i'm a bonus track on my way to japan
and i'm gonna be spread on internet
i'm a bonus track, to brazil and back
enjoying worldwide fame
they'll screw the industry, pay no royalty
burn me on cd, all illegally
chinese bootlegs, russian piracy
cuthroat germans the all copy me
and i don't give a shit, to me it's all the same
as long as i get all the fame
and the girls know my name
i don't give a fucking shit, no, i don't give a shit
don't give a fucking shit, no, no...
not a single little fucking shit
oh this is it... this is it! it!
i'm a bonus traaaaaaaaaaaaack...
am i totally blind this time when i'm dreamin'
the dreams that i fear, some call it nightmare
and some call it life, what is the sense of
existing in here
and i think of the sadness when i'm dreamin' of
leavin' the pain i don't get all that madness
and it drives me insane
now hear me cry, i'm in quest
of the key to my fate
i might be nigh to the key
in the abyss of hate
annihilation in my brain
what is the price that we will be to pay
when will you lift our little poor souls
when will you take us oh lord away
oh when will we die
why to suffer to stand up right
we are victims of time
we have to fight till the end is in sight
what's the reason to carry on
what's the reason to fall
after days of living hall
after we had to crawl,
are we totally blind this time
can't you tell me the nexus of freedom
and pain and desires and hate
and even the holy ones
waiting all the time to erase it from my mind
i feel like i've been left behind, my heart is frozen
pushed to rush and fall and again i'm gonna crawl
is there really no return from the life been chosen
you wanted more from me than i could ever be
rains is falling, pouring down on me
holy water to ease my pain, purify me
rain is falling, pouring down on me
holy water to ease my pain
i'm driving down my way to digest yesterday
under rain clouds towards the sundown to be devoured
and then come out alive
dripping wet but purified
ready to beard the memories of golden hours
no, there's nothing else than we can do
we gotta walk on through
rain is falling, pouring down on me...
when the spotlight is fading
and everyone's gone
when your thoughts come back to life
and you think of what you have done
take a look in the mirror
and then look to the past
tell me who you are
and then tell me what's gonna last
and as you take off your disguise
as you dare to open your eyes
to behold the panacea
embracing your life
oh, and then you realize
you gotta reach out
to find it all inside of you
as the spotlight fades away
you gotta reach out
to find it all inside of you
and let that spotlight fade away
it's so hard to escape from
where they say you belong
if they say don't you break the rules
you just got abandon them and then go on
and there won't be anything missin'
there won't be no grief or regret
oh, let the child inside break free
i'll find the time to be stiff when i'm dead
don't wanna be trapped in a disguise
i want it all and i wanna rise
and i dive in the panacea
embracing my life
open my eyes
reach out!
to find it all inside of you
as the spotlight fades away
you gotta reach out
to find it all inside of you
and let that spotlight fade away
reach out!
find it all inside of you
as the spotlight fades away
reach out!
find it all inside of you
and let that spotlight fade away
the ivory is cold where is my desire
in a cage of gold, not a trace of fire
ice cold as ice i'm heading for tomorrow
i am tired of waiting i'll beg and steal and borrow
life is to short to be wasted
so why do i sit around
dance on the edge of a razor
get off the ground and i'll never return
walk on fighting
don't look ever back
walk on fighting
don't you look back to your cries
the phone it waits in silence no message left by you
there is no use in crying i know i've been a fool
now it is too late no words left to say
i gotta call it fate, forget and look away
life is to short to be wasted
so why do i sit around
dance on the edge of a razor
get off the ground and i'll never return
walk on fighting
don't look ever back
walk on fighting
don't you look back to your cries
walk on fighting
music & lyrics: tobias sammet & jens ludwig
i am the madness carrying the torch
lighting the wheat in your fields
i am the eyes staring out of the dark
i am the war of your yields
when you give response away i grow
i am more of you than you might know
burning down, burning down
it's a story of deceivers
burning down, burning down
put the blame on the unbeliever
i am the vision that comes to your mind
when you denounce without regret
"god" is the word in the bible you say
i am the word that you spread
when you give response away i grow
i am more of you than you might know
burning down, burning down
it's a story of deceivers
burning down, burning down
put the blame on the unbeliever
i'm born and i lead the weak into the fire
"no more pain" is what you claim
while you have found your wicked desire
hahaha...
burning down, burning down
put the blame on the unbeliever
burning down, burning down
it's a story of deceivers
burning down, burning down
put the blame on the unbeliever
burning down, burning down
it's a story of deceivers
...and we still chase the evil  not realizing that it lurks inside of us...
roaming the plains
where a number is your name
in a palace
and you'll never find the door
oh look into the mirror
is it what you wanna see
or just a cuddle toy
the vogue has washed ashore
no i don't care what you say
into the darkness i plough my way
i'm striking out for paradise
to be the one i am
we're going down to the devil
we are striking out for paradise
to bedlam below  down to the devil
the mad parade is coming home
can't you hear the sound
as they make the hammer pound
rusty nails into a coffin of your size
to bury you alive
you mature until you're ripe
then they reap you
when you're beautiful enough
in their eyes
they lurk to wall in your belief
put up glass ceilings that you can't see
to break down the freak
they don't want you to be
we're going down to the devil...
oh we're going down
here's your invitation, your instigation
your damnation to the hellfire club
lying in the still of the night
a yearning for shelter
silence kissing your wounds, soothing your pain
darkness,and what do they know
'bout losing direction, clutchin a straw
cherish the hope to make it finally home
home, home, home, home
you long to be seethrough, so nobody can tell
whenever they make you bleed your pride away
now you're driven by one track mind, initiating you
splendid flowers, blossom from the wounds
the strong of the poison, sweetest as the bloom
don't you try to stand your ground
'cause you're only coming home
through the heart of fire
you're home, found the asylum
in a world with a broken dance, on shards of glass
i see fire, ruins and fire, and fire
in world with a broken dance, with shattered dreams
it's burning inside you, it's emotional hell
and you keep on smiling, upon the icy tides
a stream of fire, to sweep the fears away
seems like forever, too long you've had to wait
locked in darkness, for wicked harmony
little angel thrown away, she'll be back another day
through the heart of fire
you're home, found the asylum
in a world with a broken dance, on shards of glass
i see fire, ruins and fire, and fire
in world with a broken dance, with shattered dreams
now see the coma children, i see them off the beaten track
embracing and crying
come seek humiliation, now let them dance
libertation cruelty free, that's the one, the kettle's somethinng
boogeyman was sought and found
boogeyman has found a home
in the heart of fire, he's found the asylum
in world with a broken dance, on shards of glass
fire, ruins and fire, and fire
in world with a broken end, with shattered dreams
heart of fire, you're home, found the asylum
i see fire, ruins and fire, and fire
in world with a broken dance, with shattered dreams
seasons come and seasons go
here i wait for something to be
try to get as much as i can see
hungry for life
but have you see the sands of time
every day is a moment in past
every heartbeat a step to my last
i won't survive
i don't know what time is made to be
if it is a friend or enemy or does it only run
run to set and end
secrets of a crazy dream or just a bad
reality, i don't know
do you feel the sands of time
runnin' low to break the line
first we learn to fly, then we learn to cry
later in the evening we will die
questions roamin' through my brain
i'll be leavin' into a grave
i'll be dead but my soul will be save
for a time called forever
spoken:
"ladies and gentleman  welcome to the freakshow"
oh yeah...
the world
around is killing me
no thunder wind and rain
eels are crawling everywhere
compounding with the game
grind the army, the living dead, without destination
the faceless crowd is out to kill all kinds of variations
you're trying to trample down my dreams
a shot in the dark
mysteria  the spirit arising
eldrich cries from the hill
mysteria  fires are blazing
their wicked feast is shattering the still oh
seven days and nights a week
spinning like a wheel
you try to buckle, bend and break
and polish stainless steel
raging fury in the sky burning with desire
selfdetermination rising from the fire
you're trying to trample down my dreams
my disdained ideals
beware of the difference
we're savage and mean  we're a...
mysteria....
evil is the dreamer to pit himself
against the forces of the tide
you pay the see to portray
what you wanna hear what he has seen that night
oh  unholy is the feast
watch us dance around the the blazing hellfire
and lucifer arises he appears at my desire
mysteria...
you do not know
and you don't care
and you may never learn
i made approches
you gave me teeth
and got my hope injured
unprepossessing,that's what you say
don't get the essential point
what it came down to was you ain't got nothing
here's to the wicked and here's to the odd
you got your chance going down the drain
you're dumping the catch of the century
you've had your chance but you're much too vain
to take it
the catch of the century
nobody's waiting cause all the world seems like
it's already spoken for
a host of rivalsi'm out of vogue and
i'll be forevermore
you strut around sneer from on high
i'm on the road again
i'm going down with flying colors
before i go down on somebody else
you got your chance going down the drain
you're dumping the catch of the century
and lady's luck got her ass in pain you're wasting
the catch of the century

handcuffed they take the stranded straight into their lab
examine him, his dna, what you give is what you will get

anonymous protagonist encouraging the cheering masses:
this is alien drum bunnies' revenge  resistance is futile!!!
a dawn on the run, nowhere to hide in a life of
corruption, insanity has won, living in hate
and preaching destruction
i'm screaming tonight, my vengeance
to fight has killed all morality
the cries of the toll and madness control
and liberate my energy
axe to the wax !
misguidin' your life, you'll reach
the empire of madness
i will be rife, driven by insanity or hate
misguidin' your life, you'll reach
the empire of madness
i will be rife, driven by insanity
lunacy and rage are raving in my head, reign
back to back, c'mon be my slave, the beauty
in your face will be fading to black
"let me tell you a story about an ugly woman i know"
"hello girls!"
"hello tobi you hot little machine!"
i'm a sight for sore eyes
oh, if your eyes would only see
i've been born on tiptoe
still you looked
like a lighthouse next to me
you pet named me napoleon
i was proud
til i got the reason why
never aimed for confrontation
you've been sleeping
when i kissed your ass goodbye
oh, while you read this letter
i'd just gone to eat out
by the way
my what a sunshine in trinidad
hope you're okay light years away
my what a heat wave in trinidad
hope you don't mind if i stay
pitcher goes too often to the well
and now the pitcher's gone insane
gotta run away
boiling over, getting hell
and found the answer on a plane
oh, i've been pissing off
before you might
could have pissed me off
i hope you're fine, yeah
my what a sunshine in trinidad
mind if you stay? i do okay!
my what a heat wave in trinidad
sunburnt a night flight away
"honey you're looking good so far away from me
the weather is great, the beach is great, the food is great
everything is great and you're so far away, i love you honey
greetings from trinidad, hey!"
my what a sunshine in trinidad
mind if you stay? i do okay!
my what a heat wave in trinidad
sunburnt a night flight away
"back and home in germany i was a famous porn star"
tell me why can't i understand
the feelings deep inside
why do i try to scratch away the stains
deep in my heart i feel there's a place
where love and hate collide
but is everybody who asks for reasons
destined to go insane
i don't know if i'm right or wrong
the heart of twilight is much too strong
leaving the pride so i'm stopping to stride
i only dare to hide
dying, dying! my mind is what i've lost
my head is dying cold
dying, dying! my mind is what i've lost
the heart of twilight knows
an old illusion of understanding
is fading day by day
the apparition of a future vision is black
everytime i dive in depressions
the colors of life are grey
father forgive me if i decide to come back
instrumental
here i'm standing at the junction of my life
so many ways, i don't know which one is the right
do i wanna keep it up or throw it all away
or close my eyes, go on and live just for today
i'm alive, i'm alive
we're gonna dive into madness of life
heat stroke and nuts, don't live a lie
no one to blame, we don't play your game
we don't give a fuck, we're savage united
savage united we stand!
life is what happens to you while you're making plans
it's time to find your mental equilibrium again
pedal to the metal and hit the passing lane
kill the demons, cut the crap, quit their wicked game
i feel high, hell i'm high
we're gonna dive into madness of life...
sitting by the window
staring out into the night
waiting up for the light of day
and the sound of silence
the faintly flaring candle light
parting has got me
around to go insane
alone i try to while away my time
seconds turn to ages
as i close my eyes and wait
sometimes i wonder
what's the reason why
we long for someone to embrace
and say hello to say goodbye
carry on  and i will forever
longing drives bad memories away
and still carry on and i will forever
cause when i see you smile
i dare to believe again
is there anybody out there
to keep on looking for
if you don't know then lie to me
blue eyed for a letdown
if this is what it takes
to maybe see the light
i'll dare to shed another tear
oh i know
the blows cold tonight
but anyhow i gotta go
tell me girl where are you now
carry on an i will forever
i tried to build a wall
and let nobody in
to be on my own
without love and without pain
without pain
i don't know why
but everywhere
i look into your face
into your face
i am caught and i relapse again
carry on, it's forever
longing drives and memories away
carry on and i will forever
city lights are calling
slowly coming back to life
speeding in the fastlane
mama let us waste no time
devil in the doorway selling any kind of hell
we're just coming out to play the game
we never cry for love  we're superheroes
we are back where we belong
we never cry for pain  we're superheroes
make a stand where we belong
way too long i've tried to be
what i could never be
for too long you've rolled the dice
but you can't control me
i ain't talking 'bout romance
you may fiddle i may dance
anyway it's just a game we play..
we never cry for love  we're superheroes
we are back where we belong
we never cry for pain  we're superheroes
make a stand where we belong we're superheroes
you gotta move to stay alive
we're gonna rock the bash tonight..
cry for lovewe're superheroes
we are back where we belong
we never cry for love...

when you wake up in the fire
and your harbor lies in ruins
you wonder why the giant has been shot
fired off down from the sky
you plead for explanation
is it accident or rule
and where is your childhood hero
to drive all the demons away
what if the light
shines in darkness my friend
and darkness just can't comprehend
so blaze the trail on your own
go it alone
we are falling, falling to rise
pain is the guide out of the wastelands
we don't need a hero
we are falling, falling to rise
no charlatan to show you the light
we don't need a hero
indignity is the leader
to escort us to fen
where they say the light is endemic
if only i could comprehend
now you're old enough to face it
rabble's stones give pain
hit you as they watch your tracks
apart from the way that they understand
what if the light
oh we don't need a hero
no we don't need a hero
the dream is over, no one's to take the blame
we believed in roses, but only thorns remained
when i look into the rear view mirror
we create and we destroy
put our blood into a street with a dead end
walk up that stairway to jump off into the black
here we go
we go all the way, do we need the pain?
waking up in a black tomorrow
i've been there before, was it all wasted again?
we go all the way, do we need the pain?
waking up in a black tomorrow
i've been there before, was it all just wasted time?
maybe i am different, maybe i'm a fool
and i wonder if it's worth it, trying to find another you
and i look into the rear view mirror
just to see how fucked i look
while i drive along that street with a dead end.
like a moth to the flame
it's gonna suck me into pain
still we go
we go all the way, do we need the pain?
waking up in a black tomorrow
i've been there before, was it all wasted again?
we go all the way, do we need the pain?
waking up in a black tomorrow
i've been there before, was it all just wasted time?
what are we heading for?
what do i dare again?
once beaten, twice shy
and still we haven't learned
so here i'm lying
a leisurepoet in pain
involuntary loner
i know that life is just a game
but nobody gets out alive
a sedative shot for me
no happy man gets out alive
neither of us you will see
we go all the way, do we need the pain?
waking up in a black tomorrow
i've been there before, was it all wasted again?
we go all the way, do we need the pain?
waking up in a black tomorrow
i've been there before, was it all just wasted time?
i see your face in a masquerade
i see your made up smile
when the show is over what is left behind?
its in your eyes, its in your hair
how come they say opposites attract?
when all you feel is a struggle deep inside?
don't tell no lies, no more disguise
i'm tracing the matrix of my life
the damage is done, you don't belong
deep down in the matrix
i'm feeling pushed, from left to right
is this the way it's meant to be?
is my destiny crawling on my knees?
now who is right? and who is wrong?
who is the one that won't belong?
who's for real? and who's just pretending to be?
don't tell no lies, no more disguise
i'm tracing the matrix of my life
the damage is done, you don't belong
deep down in the matrix
no more lies, no more disguise
into the matrix
into the matrix
no more lies, no disguise
i'm tracing the matrix
no more...
lies, no more disguise
i'm tracing the matrix of my life
the damage is done, you don't belong
deep down in the matrix
no more lies, no disguise
tracing the matrix of my life
the damage is done, you don't belong
deep down in the matrix
into the matrix
oh if only brazil was not so far
far away i would swim or walk or ride
but never ever fly
but all the noise of the maniacs there
the sweat on my face it's worth to bear
but i don't wanna bounce and die
but then i see a lady in a tight blue dress
i close my eyes, i know what i would go for
stewardess before the crash
lavatory love machine
no fear can quell my steam
lavatory love machine
no cabin fire burn my dream
i am at your disposal
i gotta get up to see what you ain't gotta hide
wheeling junk along the aisle
keep your seat belf fastened
you're whipping with an iron voice
you command
uh mistress i am in your hands
and when she asks me what i'd like to eat
i realise the domina feels the same
and i reply: what about your pie?
lavatory love machine...
lavatory love machine
no broken wings to stop me stream
lavatory love machine
honey dou you like the way i cry?
now if i gotta die
i'll have been stiff and smiling till the crash
let them know i've been alive
till i made my final splash
lavatory love machine...
don't hear the scary noises
from the turbine when you scream
don't know where i come from
don't know where to go
don't know if i know
what is good to be known
i wonder if madness
is just a child
of my urge to know
the more that i ask
the more i get down
a million times
my quest for life is pain
but still it has not made me going insane
and i long for more
for a trace of life
tearing down all doors
for a trace of life
you tell me you wonder
if wondering is heaven or hell
you say that you've got the view
on the dark side of life
you can't see the shadows
the others can see
but you can see it's well:
the sun and the day
the light in the sky
a million times
your quest for life has been pain
but still it is the key to make you sane
ravens in the air, no one in the streets
seems like the fiend he must be back
riding on his horse but also flying in the iar
love has just started to crack  ow
whiplash and torture, falseness and pain
envy is driving our hate
everything out there is mad and confused
till we'll be able to seal each others fate
staring through eyes of hate and able to kill
we don't realize we've been given our own
fuckin' will, like animals humans don't think
don't look for a reason, we hate no style
we put the blame on the demon
sacred hell, sacred hell
there is nothing but names on the wall
you can be free, you can reach tomorrow
sacred hell, sacred hell
so the fend must be back on our ball
lose all your sins, lose all your sorrows
no lucid intervals, no people who guide
but a 1000 masters of disguise
eternal damnation 'cause humans they hide
they think that satan shall rise
i have seen tears fallin'like some rain
hiding from nothing and noone but still i'm feeling pain
feeling bitter pain
bleedin' for nothing, tortured to be kind
liars with fear will be everything you will
leave behind
i'm not gonna eat it i'm striking back !
i show you the way of my life
raise your fuckin' fists and then attack
we will never be to cry
we are back, we are back, we are back
children of steel
we are back, we are back, we are back
we're children of steel  we are children of steel
tortured by teachers, eaten by the system
chewed from the preachers, shot by the guns of society
transforming to weapons i know you can tell
and if you don't like us then we're gonna go back to hell ha ha ha
we're not gonna take it we're striking back
i show you the way of my life
raise your fuckin' fists and then attack
we will never be to cry
we are back, we are back, we are back
we're children of steel
we are back, we are back, we are back
children of steel  we are children of steel
now can you hear us cry
children of the night
united we channel the power
and we'll be back to fight ! yeah !
fiddle & classic solo: ludwig
we're not gonna take it we're striking back
i show you the way of my life
raise your fuckin' fists and then attack
we will never be to cry
we are back, we are back, we are back
children of steel
we are back, we are back, we are back
we're children of steel
we are back, we are back, we are back
children of steel
we are back, we are back, we are back
we're children of steel  we are children of steel
the desert in the blazing sun
i feel my throat is burning
the guard is incorruptable
you name it vanity or yearning  oh
now  dusty wind into my face
we gotta build it higher and higher
oh the sun is whipping from above
your child in chains of desire
and craving towers
from the desert towards the sky
the grind of the genius
who's raising his own decline
and the navigator is heading for hell
setting off on a journey
and he'll never return
and the navigator he rose and he fell
in quest for heaven
he'll never return
hey the seeker reaching for the stars
beyond the scape of profanity
oh and when he tried to touch the light
fire burned his sanity away
oh i gotta see it all
tempting deities i hear them
but then when you follow their call
pride goes before the fall
and the navigator...
waiting for a little sign
seems like to no avail
strolling down the pavement aimlessly
waiting for someone to snatch her bag of memories
how come you call it destiny?
when the cross you bear's your only company
never seen you, i don't even know you're name
but still i believe
that you are gonna save me
somehow i got a notion
just a little affection on this cold and windy road
save me, from a state of unemotion
just a little affection on this windy road
why so long? so confusing?
why's growing up hurt so bad?
seek what we had lost, we get found and go again
i don't know what's gone to me
i won't make any promise i believe
never seen you, i don't even know you're name
but still i believe
that you are gonna save me
somehow i got a notion
just a little affection on this cold and windy road
save me, from a state of unemotion
just a little affection on this windy road
i don't know if i can, i don't know if i should
i don't know what is right, and what's to come if you would
here i stand in rain, here in stand in the cold
i been locked into something, another shout in my soul, no
i'm afraid of that harm
save, save me, got a notion
that you are gonna save me
somehow i got a notion
just a little affection on this cold and windy road
save me, from a state of unemotion
just a little affection on this windy road
music: sammet & ludwig  lyrics: sammet
good intentions pave the way of the human child
heading for the fork as you walk the path of life
a spell cast from the hiding woods, don't you close your eyes
the snake is waiting anytime to penetrate your mind
don't you hear voices whispering, incline to walk down
don't you see the shadow on the wall, angel eyes... the one cast out to fall
calling me to look up to the sky we follow but we never know oh why
a vision revealing a child down where i've sure never been
an angel who's touching the flame, oh the angel is me
nailed, nailed to the wheel  nailed, let the cut run deep
nailed, nailed to the wheel  nailed, i said go  let bleed!  go,  let bleed!
solo: jens
feel it crawl, feel the magic coming over like a daze
welcome as the poison for the cornered snake
taste of sin, bitter sweet, never, never let us go
but never, never, never is a price we'd pay to grow
they call it original sin, some call it divine
the moment the evil appeared... the chance to decide
repeat chorus
from children in cradles to hangmen who smile
lick up the blood from the blade of your knife
walk the stairway, leading down, ride on fire, take the crown
your mind could be strong but your flesh will be mine
he's offering those kingdoms, they all could be thine
rising powers, tempting gold, but at what price would it be sold?
it's all up to you...
solo: jens
repeat chorus
never deamed that i could fall
but something's come over me
now i'm sitting staring at the wall
afraid for my sanity, yeah
the sound of your voice
the touch of your skin
is haunting me, haunting me
i still try to come to my senses
but it's too late now
so i'm taking my chances
i wanna give you my heart
give you my soul
i wanna lay in your arms
never let go
don't wanna live my life without you
but i know when you're gone
like a fire needs a spark
like a fool in the dark
honey, i'll cry for you
wondering why i'm running scared
from what i believe in
i know that love is just another word
to say what i'm feeling
for once in my life
the future is mine
it's calling me, calling me
i've been searching so long for an answer
but it's too late now
so i'm taking my chances
i wanna give you my heart
give you my soul
i wanna lay in your arms
never let go
don't wanna live my life without you
but i know when you're gone
like a fire needs a spark
like a fool in the dark
honey, i'll cry for you
i wanna give you my heart
cry for you
i wanna lay in your arms
cry for you
i wanna give you my heart
cry for you
i wanna lay in your arms
honey, i'll cry for you now
i sought salvation but i found insanity
lost in a mass i returned to profanity
i've been reaching for the sky
but i am stuck with my feet, down in concrete
don't you run away now, don't you be afraid
now there is a meaning, whoah oh oh
don't you run away now, don't you live a lie
there's more to life to show you, take a rocket ride
suffering my way with divine aspiration
i failed to resist the sweetest temptation
been stuck to religion 'till i clung to the pie
you never really miss it, until you really try
tried to jump but i'm down by concrete
the memories surrounding my fate faith?
don't you run away now, don't you be afraid
now there is a meaning, whoah oh oh
don't you run away now, don't you live a lie
there's more to life to show you, take a rocket ride
i've tried to reach higher, but my flesh is too weak
i've been searching for answers, i been led to the fire
there must be a reason for us to be down here
i'm driftin, yeah temptation, carried out to the sea
i'm driftin, i'm driftin away, i'm driftin away
i've been reaching for the sky
but i am stuck with my feet, down in concrete
don't you run away now, don't you be afraid
now there is a meaning, whoah oh oh
don't you run away now, don't you live a lie
there's more to life to show you, take a rocket ride
watching the eventide, the sun will hide and sleep
my heart's beat is slow. i'm thinking about my belief
rain washing over me cleaning up my brain
till i question all my thoughts
and clean 'em up from stains
clean 'em up from stains
clean 'em up from stains, yeah
die free, yeah!
welcome to the circle of those who know their way
welcome to those who've realized their needs
who don't need fear to pray and betray
but they don't accept us living free
believing what we need
haven't heard anything about poetry
they only know their painful greed
don't ever trust those who say they know
those who show and force you to bow
i've done no wrong but to ask my brain
to be free from pain built up by those who reign
chorus
a mind in disguise now i know
it's better to hide my belief than feeding the crow
a life on the run now i know
the kingdom of disguise is the last place to go
in the eyes of the world i'm a master of heresy
swimming against the tide  endangering democracy
i remember the day when i was young and bold
when i thought that my mind was free
until the time that i was told
out in the night they laugh about me and my knowledge and
speak prayers our god don't want to hear. but listen:
wherever you are, i will get you! well, you don't know who
i am? i am the inquisition and i am your heretics
barbarian end!
beware and be silent and follow the sign
keep the mission as a secret of your mind
one out of a million is a friend of your line
don't forget there are evil eyes behind
holding the candle she was found in the rain
bright eyes and blissful but they thought
that she went astray
too late to escape, she seemed to be insane
she got imprisoned because she got her own way
now can't you remember?
what have you done?
believe me, i'm innocent. i've done no wrong!
but you are strange! you are guilty i guess!
and after the torture you will confess and burn!
ending in the flames, burning down her fame
prayers to the saints, their end of an evil game
run to your last refuge
maybe the silence of your voice
lie but be true to yourself
sometimes you've got no choice
follow a king called silence
live in his kingdom of disguise
there is a temple of shelter
where god forgives you your lies.
run to your last refuge
maybe the silence of your voice
lie but be true to yourself
sometimes you've got no choice
follow a king called silence
live in his kingdom of disguise
there is a temple of shelter
where god forgives you your lies.
i can see it bright here in front of your eyes
the apparition never dies
yes i see, yes i feel, yes i know it all
i've just returned to give you fears
to bring you pain as much as tears
you'll never know what's in my mind
it's an invitation to my way
pray to me or you will pay
when i'm smiling what's behind
chorus: x2
i'll be tearing down you paradise
i'll be bringing you down
no warning, i'm pawning
now let us open up the gate
leave your way before it's too late
into the heart of dark insanity
as black as hate but even white
it must be the dragon that i ride
something burning my reality.
always listen to what they tell  dreamer
crazy habits are a work of hell  dreamer
dressed in black and ordinary suits  dreamer
all my life i have paid my dues  goodbye
but here i am
to go my way
but here i am
i am sick of being here to pay
never try to understand  dreamer
what i do and what i can  dreamer
making love in the middle of a street  dramer
let them talk about how we treat ourselves  that's right
but here i am
to go my way
but here i am
i am sick of being here to stay
ravens in the air, no one in the streets
seems like the fiend he must be back
riding on his horse but also flying in the iar
love has just started to crack  ow
whiplash and torture, falseness and pain
envy is driving our hate
everything out there is mad and confused
till we'll be able to seal each others fate
staring through eyes of hate and able to kill
we don't realize we've been given our own
fuckin' will, like animals humans don't think
don't look for a reason, we hate no style
we put the blame on the demon
sacred hell, sacred hell
there is nothing but names on the wall
you can be free, you can reach tomorrow
sacred hell, sacred hell
so the fend must be back on our ball
lose all your sins, lose all your sorrows
no lucid intervals, no people who guide
but a 1000 masters of disguise
eternal damnation 'cause humans they hide
they think that satan shall rise
i can't feel, and i can't see
i'm falling down what's going on with me
lord in heaven why am i here
do i live to rise or rise to fall to shed another tear
one more time i fell that i'm alone
i can't describe it cause it's better to be shown
feel the darkness covering the spite
hear me screaming when it's pounding deep inside
forever i'll be a poisoned thorn
i'll be haunting among your lives
the moment i was born it was time for him to rise
chorus
deadmaker, deadmaker
why don't you realize
that he can paralyze you all
my sorrow created by you
and even me cause i'm a selfdestroying fool
i feel the spirit growing deep inside
i don't expect your comprehension
'cause even i don't know why
in the silence there's a fear
it's growing stronger with every breath i take
a fire inside that drives me mad
a haunt of darkness that makes me stay awake
but is it just a trace of evil
or is it the force to bring me down
i feel like being chained by my noble reputation
i feel like being killed by a square and boring nation
it doesn't matter how but i know that i want out
take a trip with me, stay a dream on broken
watch them play their game, no one here can stop it
walpurgis night is closer than every holy day
longing for silence...
"always faster" is the way that we go.
not a little patience...
higher, farer, better we grow.
the beast is rising. it?s tantalizing
those who are taking the time.
alienation... a revelation...
straight to the end of the line...
fly! riding away... rising today...
no we don't play your headless game!
we are alive, don't say goodbye.
fly! riding away... rising today...
no we don't play your headless game!
we are alive, don't say goodbye.
cast out from eden...
you don't like what we are in your eyes.
we're leading the treason on the race you run,
the way of your life.
i am danger, i'm a stranger
cause i don't give in to your call.
and not until she is satisfied
we can come and explode and we fall!!!
we're blowing the frame of your headless game:
we don't follow!
...in their eyes we are insane! but aren't daydreamers only the escapists of
a soulless view of life?...
don't place your trust in foolish promises sworn
nor cryptic message scrawled upon every wall
street corner justice beware
the spirit will find you always be fair
the shallow verse once read means nothing at all
nor fearful gestures made for instant recall
in lies your heart will not share
the spirit inside used without care
chorus
the spirit that guides you follow it through
to the spirit inside you always be true
you know you'll despair
if the spirit inside is used without care
the battlefield of glory pales into rust
the river flows much thicker fed by each thrust
no beast alive does compare
the spirit beside you everywhere
let not your head be turned by tainted reward
and dreams of fortune won forever to hoard
your conscience could not repair
the spirit inside used without care
cause it will be your shelter, help you how to decide
and it will be your helper should your loyalties divide

here alone now i'm staring at the sea
behind the far horizon
is there a better place for me?
afraid to drown, afraid to dive
scared by fears and the hot sunlight, yeah
and i dance in the rain, dive in the pool of life
wash away the poison
and i dance through this pain, my body in a starless night
to wash away the poison from my soul, turn it to gold
between the devil and the deep sea
i don't know how to carry on
i only feel that inner force that's pushing me along
the tides of life bring clarity for my tumbling mind
i'll dive to see, set me free

darkness has covered the opera house
something is wrong you can feel
there's a devil in disguise
a traitor has taken the dais
catalogue people spend a pitying gaze
what can a man do in such a case
aristocratic experts on art vomit all over the place
and they wish i'd be doomed eternally
forever frenchfrying
you'd love to see me dying
who's let the peacock in
to rock the house opera house
you want me frenchfried and
you'd love to see me fired and
then kill the judas in the opera house
opera house
huntsmen are rushing around
after the peacock, oh no
the baton is pink and it's clear
he is a queer
he likes it into his rear
rumors arise he is from outerspace
they're out for the bounty
and still they're amazed
aristocratic lemmings with a highsnobiety leer
get the chef to make peacock fillet steak
forever frenchfrying

who's let the peacock in

you want me frenchfried and
you'd love to see me fired and

facing your goggle eyes
to protect this jolly bedlam from decay
facing your goggle eyes
who do you think you are
to think you're of a better class?
who do you think you are
to expect us to kiss your ass?
we've come to chase the monkey off your back
facing your goggle eyes
and we've expected some may sound an attack
facing your goggle eyes
who do you think you are
to think you're of a higher class?
who do you think you are
to expect us to kiss your ass?
we're gonna be
taking the chance taking the chance
to get you darting a glance darting a glance
at us to starting to prancestarting the dance
of the oddballs
frankenstein is out of control
donkey has been given a soul
flamboyantly he's playing his song
and they can't get it
the nuthead he is going insane
the screwball is igniting the flame
pandora's box has opened behold
madness rising
you say treason but i tell you
there ain't no reason
we just have our share
we don't care as long as we're alive
love our sound and like to hear
where's the chef to make judasfillet steak

now if you gaze up to the moon
see she's become as blood and soon
the time is right:
we gotta pave the way
you gather silk to weave the net
entrap the strongest you can get
a soul that's ready to return again
see the purity shining from his eyes
a newborn angel
to help the chosen ones rise
blood red prophet in the sky
we're standing under the moon
come down with fire
see the creature come alive
standing under the moon
come down with fire
down with fire
down with fire
good intentions raise a mind
a new messiah to judge the blind
kill off the fools
who bar my pure and holy plan
we lead creation by the nose
to bring divinity to those
who know tonight a golden age begins
divine is the spirit
into a terrestrial shell
a savior of human blood
lead us to somewhere
to heaven or hell
blood red prophet in the sky...
i saw her coming in high heels
moving like a queen
a little sweet angel but deep underneath
a mean machine
you're lying in wait to make me a fool
you want me to bite
i'm gonna take the bait and the hunter for afters
i'll take you for a ride
i don't wanna play no games
cause i'm a bad bad boyall around
let me be your titanic before you know what's going on
i may go down..
fucking with firei'm coming to rock
got my rocket on fire and i take what i want
fucking with fireloaded and cocked
you never miss it until you've begun
with the hair force one
don't make no mistakes,don't you miss out
on the hell of a time
i'm a real gogetter and there's no doubt
that down the line
i know what you want and i know what you need
your secret desire got the gloves of a man
the hands of a beast
and my pants on fire
and i don't wanna play no games
cause i'm a nasty bad boyall around, around
let me be your titanic, before you know what's going on
i'm going down...
fucking..
we're the little creatures
deep inside your mind
some call us their fantasy
but some do never find
we can teach philosophy
but still we must commend...
the state of our existence
right into your hand
welcome to this place in here
come overstep all your fears...
where have you all been once
when i was alone?
when i was a hero
in their crazy wicked show
you've sent no little spark
into my darkened view of life.
did not make me ask
for what is wrong and what is right.
and still i regret to be here.
i'm dreaming of anna in tears...
inside, so deep inside
you will die if i don't dream anymore
inside, so deep inside
you will die if i don't dream anymore...
inside, so deep inside
die if i don't dream anymore
inside, so deep inside
die if i don't dream anymore...
dream anymore...
oh yeah...
thirsting for salvation
you're off to find the stairway
novice on your never ending ride
whatever you may find dare to take it higher
here's your instigation on your trip into the light
standing at the temple
where the wizard shall arise
you listen to the beauty of a song
a melody of promise calling from the dark
tear down the portal and then go on
come and fly away with me
and your eyes are gonna see it all
and sleep with the fire  do you feel me
go obtain divinity, be the one you wanna be
and don't be afraid to give in
and ride into the shadows
the piper never dies, never dies
ride into the shadows
the piper never dies, never dies
entites are screaming, enticing from inside
creatures you had never ever seen
and on the back of houghtiness
you leave into the light
the spirit on a mission in the shell of a beast
the ferryman is gentle
and promises are made
the other side may hold a lot to see
he's gonna take you over
and then he'll name the fare
oh you gamble with the devil, fool
the ferryman is me
come and fly away...
balance on the edge of day and night
not afraid of falling
time has come to see all wrong from right
something's calling
heaven and hell is it all the same
and just a different grade
now i gotta know the point of change
where love turns to hate
balance on the edge of day and night
dive into the haze and kiss the light
many of the tales you've been told
never written for the brave and bold
come and take my hand tonight
come and sleep with me tonight
certainly i'm gonna take you there
showing you around everywhere
do you belive that you're devil may care
as you jump into the fire
do you belive that you're devil may care
as you jump into the fire
dreamer, dreamer, dreamer...
ride into the shadows... you go on  into the night
alright, the piper never dies, i got you hypnotised
come with me and witness, see babylon arise
the whore is fading light, let us step inside
o got you paralysed child, the piper never dies
the pied piper plays the song, beatiful but strong
he was never born, never he'll be gone
oh the pied piper never dies
he never dies, never dies...

from the cradle of silence and of light
it took a birth in human blood  angels cry 
to the ages of violence and of hate
to explore the left hand path i came alive
into my striding, the shell of a god in the cold
my soul is just hiding, my spirit haunting on to control
flame of the nile, fire in the darkness
to swallow the light
behold the ghost of a god
god from the nile, eternally roaming
to swallow the light
behold the spirit of a pharaoh,
pharaoh, pharaoh, no!
solo: jens
to the world of spirits he's sailling on and on
why magician don't you feel they broke the seal
cyril's facing the tyrant everywhere
far away from his grave, seth is free
roaming through ages
begetting advice for your kings, yow...
leading the stages
of history that's bound to my strings, no, no, no...
repeat chorus
solo: jens
don't you see that it's coming, it's near
the wise man screamed in the noble chamber
just a parrot in a rich man's cage
he's a jester on the count
the wise man died and the seance went on
and the red one reigned in the noble chamber
in dreams of a masterplan
for a billion parrots in a big cage
afraid of the eyes that shine in the darkness
you don't realize, afraid in the haze
you point at the man that grins in your nightmare
and don't realize the mirror you gaze into
you don't wanna see the spirits behind sceneries
solo: jens
i guide your way i make you stay alive
my servants taught you know how to survive
the way of light is food for your soul
but it's your belly that's taken control
no guiding light would shine anymore
it's just the red god replacing the core
he'll rise again to open up the gate
we have to learn for our future, our fate...

blinded by the fire and the sorrow of the day,
i come knocking at your door
to dry the tears away.
the eventide is calling me to take a look into your eyes.
pull me on and make me mesmerized
riding on the wings of light,
dreaming dreams and holding tight
leaving all my sorrow far behind.
your eyes are the gate
to the land of the miracle where our love can make us fly, make us fly.
in the land of the miracle
we can find a reason why and how we can fly.
open up the book of madness,
read the page of life!
who's the one to tell you what to do
and how to rise?
and if the stars would fall one day
i'd climb up to the sky
to put them back for you to save your smile.
take a look into the book of fantasy and poetry and you will see:
what you can feel is everything you need to heal your crying mind,
the soul behind and everything that you may find inside your head...
a million years have passed away to make us head for the decay and to unlearn just
what we yearn for all day long: right to be strong and stick to our ideals,
are they for real and do we just have lost the thread?
i believe in miracles they happen every day.
in your arms a dream comes true for me
isn't poetry one of the biggest gifts to forget our daily life of sorrow?
you're a child of an old illusion
can't you hear it cry?
you live your life to the exclusion
of what they call a lie
the touch of evil it is getting stronger
you'd better hide in the daylight
or you won't stand the temptation no longer
and you will ask if your way is right
do not ask the preacher why
all your fears keep it alive
waiting for the end of time
holy shadows, always follow
holy chains on holy shadows
when you are eve then i am temptation
i am the words you're not allowed to say
the animal of their revelation
'cause i can take your fears away
they make you blind and they want you to follow
"free love is sin! desire's slavery!"
my wicked kiss on your virgin lips
will be a pleasant way you'll see it
do not ask the preacher why
all your fears keep it alive
waiting for the end of time
holy shadows, always follow
holy chains on holy shadows
let's get down on the floor
you'll be screaming for more
when out bodies collide
i'll make you feel alright
never give in when they call it sin
waiting for the end of time
holy shadows, always follow
holy chains on holy shadows
holy shadows, always follow
holy chains on holy shadows
holy shadows, always follow
holy chains on holy shadows
... father, forgive her for giving in to her lust,
for being not able to stand the temptation...and for enjoying it!...
i am the madness carrying the torch
lighting the wheat in your fields
i am the eyes staring out of the dark
i am the war of your yields
when you give response away i grow
i am more of you than you might know
burning down, burning down
it's a story of deceivers
burning down, burning down
put the blame on the unbeliever
i am the vision that comes to your mind
when you denounce without regret
"god" is the word in the bible you say
i am the word that you spread
when you give response away i grow
i am more of you than you might know
burning down, burning down
it's a story of deceivers
burning down, burning down
put the blame on the unbeliever
i'm born and i lead the weak into the fire
"no more pain" is what you claim
while you have found your wicked desire
hahaha
burning down, burning down
put the blame on the unbeliever
burning down, burning down
it's a story of deceivers
burning down, burning down
put the blame on the unbeliever
burning down, burning down
it's a story of deceivers
and we still chase the evil, not realizing that it lurks inside of us
he was born into this world
living love but he got hurt
and he sighed when he beheld
the bleeding lamb
blood and tears drip on the ground
dung the olives on the mount
love is crucified, made way
for the greed of man
there's no way out of here
no we don't, don't wanna take it no more
no we don't, don't wanna wait forever
golden dawn, a new age has begun
golden dawn, in every single one
don't you run away, don't say it's all too late
start to ring in the age... the golden dawn
killing brothers, sick ideals, tvshow lie and reveal
poor philistine reasons why to hate a man
it's so easy to give in, do your dirty trick and win
join those lemmings to the shore and fly but then
don't complain if you'll drown in the end
kill to eat, when you're the final one
there's no one to compete
then find the time to think of a...

another day is coming
a new day has begun
an eagle is rising slowly to the skies of no return
disappearing in the growing sun
so proud and so beautiful
thinking about tomorrow with tears in his eyes
once a lot of brothers spread their wings to join his way
now he's left alone in a world of lies
cry for tomorrow
why don't we hear the eagles cries
living in sorrow
why don't we help him to survive
once a dignity, a mighty sign of pride
strong and proud and free
a symbol of eternity, why don't we see
we can't survive, if we don't realize
our world is a place that can't be created twice
oh yeah
watching a face and a smile and a light
when yo're walking alone in the street
i know your look always gives you the might
many miles from your ass to your feet
and i dream what i've seen
is what i want it to be selfmade reality
how many miles to the gate of reality
how many steps left to go to my dreams
how many miles to the land where my dreams come true
dreams which come true just have died
look like a queen but you talk like a pawn and i know you're a fool in disguise
godfather tell me how to carry on
blinded by fantasies of lies
and i dream what i've seen
is what i want it to be self made reality
how many miles to the gate of reality
how many steps left to go to my dreams
how many miles to the land where my dreams come true
dreams which come true just have died
i see your smile, a golden masquerade
and i know my dream it will be my fate
time has stolen my fantasy
'cause it has become a pale reality
how many miles to the gate of reality
how many steps left to go to my dreams
how many miles to the land where my dreams come true
dreams which come true just have died
faking the truth in their eyes
smile but they really deride
never give you shelter
lady all alone, naked to the bone
make you bleed and melt into tears
down on your knees you will see
what you could be
raise the power in your eyes
make us rise to make us say
down and alone, arrows fly
breaking on my soul
down and alone, arrows fly
i remember times
when arrows hit me causing pain
all alone i've found my soul
and now my soul is sane
the night has come down on the land
i want to reach out for her land
but she takes another
lonesome in my room, staring at the moon
treated like a bother
down on my knees i have seen
what i can be
raise the power in my eyes
makes me rise to make me say
down and alone, arrows fly
breaking on my soul
down and alone, arrows fly
i remember times
when arrows hit me causing pain
all alone i've found my soul
and now my soul is sane
down and alone, arrows fly
breaking on my soul
down and alone, arrows fly
i remember times
when arrows hit me causing pain
all alone i've found my soul
and now my soul is sane
isn't loneliness a good reason to become acquainted with yourself?
and when you're down and out, aren't you compelled to face yourself?
and if you know yourself, can the arrows of the world outside hurt you anymore?

cold in the wind, starless the night
rain pouring down when the last one arrives
so many stories telling of pain
are told by the freaks they've been throwing away
ride out, set off to the sea
odd fellows, you and me
sail on to a world far away
that might not exist, we must be insane
torn and feathered
put in the pillory my friend
accused as a fool marching on
in quest for a place they don't know
to jerusalem
the piper inside, can't you feel him calling
you don't be afraid of the horizon
to jerusalem
don't you give in to their fingers pointing
so don't be afraid, you won't crash at the horizon
the dwarf and the giant, children who stray
the dreamer who's walking far off their way
a jester cast out, he can't laugh anymore
here comes the freakshow... welcome on aboard
torn and feathered
they'll never get what you say
kill what they don't understand
don't know and don't even try

lord of fate, i feel you deep inside my brain...
is it really just a dream or the urge to survive?
...and during an odyssey through the back of my mind a vision appeared to make
me realize who holds the key to my fate...
when you're walking down the empty road
feel like creeping, crawling, cold and bare
and you're afraid of mistery scaryface

the master's final word
when he created a 'hero' like you
born to deride and to hurt
you don't try to find a reason why
you don't have a brain
you don't want to have a brain
you are just a masquerade, just a nice facade
in a snob parade, i know
you don't know
you don't have to wait, i'll be too late
when you meet to jump off the edge
you don't have to wait, i'll be too late
when you meet to jump off the edge
i'm not like you and i don't want to be
follow the times to a place you can't see
don't call in doubt what the fashing may bring
and you'll be falling down
hammer the nail into what you don't know
keep on believing you're strong
you got your pride and i got my peace
there's no sense in proving you wrong
we will fight just to stand upright
we are here to dare
we will fight, we are here to dare
guts to sail against the stream, to defend the dream
to do what we feel, i know
we will fight

they make you a pawn in the game
for we all are deaf, dumb and blind
after the storm when the magic has gone
drown in the tears of a mandrake
pawn in the game, invisible chains
try to move, you'll feel as they graze
after the storm when the magic has gone
drown in the tears of a mandrake
fading away, the final decay
try to move, break out from your chains
when you're off to the hall of the serpent
see the cynic who's counting his gold
while gun runners, priests and clairvoyants
are dancing around the rising demon
you are taught to eat up all the crap they shit
parading your nuts on a silver plate
kill your brother by the blade they sell
for you don't unite
they reap your bondage sowing evil
there's no use to tell what i've seen
they know how to make you believe
just what they want you to know

as bad as never before
a bleeding wag is fading away
once you needed me
for spending delight
but below the funny mask
there's a crying face
the way that i smile is the way that i cry
but you'll never realize
my reputation is the one of a fool
now watch how poet dies
hear his cries

and i dedicate my roses to no one
cause there is no mind to help me to see
the reason we need
a light for the lonesome
and no none to drink
the blood that i bleed
the poet inside  wasn't given a chance
so he had to live apart
and i realized  my best friend am i
and not those parasites
who try to stare into my heart
the way that i feel is the way that i heal
my body and soul and my life
and i know you just think i'm a fool
now watch how a poet flies, see me rise

the moment when you held me tight
won't come back anymore
and at the end of that night
you slammed the door
my dream it died away
just when i saw red
and nothing but a memory
is left inside my head
nothing is forever in life
but a memory believe it's true
and when i gaze in the rain
i'm crying just for you
the scarlet rose has died
lost inside the night
left in my mind like a dream and full of pride
the scarlet rose has died
the one and only way to catch
the beauty of a dawn
is to take a picture
of the growing sun
i got that experience
no one could steal away
one moment of your life is mine
i remember day by day
nothing is forever in life
but a memory  believe it's true
and when i gaze in the rain
i'm crying just for you
the scarlet rose has died
lost inside the night
left in my mind like a dream and full of pride
the scarlet rose has died
the scarlet rose has died
lost inside the night
left in my mind like a dream and full of pride
the scarlet rose has died
the scarlet rose has died
lost inside the night
left in my mind like a dream and full of pride
the scarlet rose has died
the rain outside reminds me of your voice
like everything i hear since you're not there
and distance doesn't leave me any choice
than to meet you in a dream we still can share
in my dream i see your smile
but when i open up my eyes
i can't see anyone
now that you have gone away
i wonder if we'll reach the day
that you will realize that we belong
i can't take it for granted
i remember your smile
i can't take it for granted
cause i know that our life is in line
for another day or life in another time
in another time, in another time
the pressure and the fear it made you blind
you thought you have to give some burden away
but are you really sure if it's required?
don't you want to find out another day?
in my dream i see your smile
but when i open up my eyes
i can't see anyone
now that you have gone away
i wonder if we'll reach the day
that you will realize that we belong
i can't take it for granted
i remember your smile
i can't take it for granted
cause i know that our life is in line
for another day or life in another time
in another time, in another time
i can't take it for granted, i can't take it
i remember your smile, i remember
i can't take it for granted, i can't take it
cause i know that our life is in line
for another day or life in another time

"i've heard voices in my dream.
made me stand up, helped me see. aaah... oohhh...
visions called him to awake his mind,
to find his horizon
and find out what may be behind.
vision: "take what you need,
you can find in the back of your soul!
wake up the king in yourself
to be mighty and bold!"
seasons of doubt,
fear and silent desires of life have gone by.
visions have called back my longing
for freedom tonight. made me sigh...
wasting my life till the day
that the voice has appeared... made me see:
i am the one that can make it
through times of despair i am free!"
they built up a symbol of warning
to give me fear,
to keep me away from paradise
although it's so near,
expecting i don't take a look
at what is behind: freedom calling...
take a look at the open gate!
walk on and don't be afraid!
free your mind in what they call
it's the heart of temptation!
...oh... go the way!
take a look at the open gate!
walk on and don't be afraid!
free your mind in what they call
it's the heart of temptation!
night after night
i remembered the word of the priest:
"thou shalt not! never give in to the promises made by the beast,
so help me god!
never give in to temptation or you'll burn in hell a long, long time!
forevereternalsalvation is
what i can sell if you stay blind!!!"
but i want to know what lies behind the gate of their hell.
and i won't believe all the stories that
they always tell. i got the mind to find out what is right and what's wrong.
freedom calling...
queen of mine i long for you.
tell me why to wait to find our joy!
it's your wait for heaven's door,
your fear that makes them grow
and let you forget today.
i'll never go and i'll stay on your side.
they'll never know what i give to you
is a piece of paradise.
heaven can wait! now i'm living!
heaven can wait forevermore.
heaven can wait!
i am to live like i want to also before i'll die.
heaven can wait! you can't thrill me!
heaven can wait, we dance till we die!
heaven can wait! welcome to the
theater of salvation
"hallelujah, hallelujah!"
i hear the man in black, his
"hallelujah, hallelujah!"
he tries to keep me back. no!
"hallelujah, hallelujah!"
lock up the gates to wisdom
hallelujah, hallelujah...
too late! i've found the kingdom...
hallelujah, hallelujah!
i see a band of angels.
hallelujah, hallelujah!
freedom calling...
hallelujah, hallelujah!
i do not fear the stories.
hallelujah, hallelujah!
freedom calling me...
don't you see it? don't you feel it?
freedom calling...
...and the vision finally added: "go and find the answers in yourself
and always remember: 'you're already living.'
don't let them scare you on your quest for answers and for salvation 
for real salvation...
the ivory is cold, where is my desire
in a cage of gold, not a trace of fire
ice cold as ice. i'm heading for tomorrow
i am tired of waiting. i'll beg and steal and borrow
life is too short to be wasted
so why do i sit around
dance on the edge of a razor
get off the ground and i'll never return
walk on fighting
don't look ever back
walk on fighting
don't you look back to your cries
the phone it waits in silence, no message left by you
there is no use in crying. i know i've been a fool
now it's too late, no words left to say
i gotta call it late, forget and look away
life is too short to be wasted
so why do i sit around
dance on the edge of a razor
get off the ground and i'll never return
walk on fighting...
into a place of darkness he was born to live alone
he got one big desire, one day he'd get the crown,
hey devil come on help me now
be the one to pull my string
let me be your slave to serve you
to let me be the king
just give me a sign
take on my mind and let me stay blind
a victim of life too weak to be kind

out of control
help me to gain the crown, here is my fate
wherever i may roam there will be hate and pain
eye for eye, tooth for tooth, respect is what i gain

are you the one who failed to listen
to what the pundits say?
don't hesitate to phrase desire
you fail to exercise prudence and passivity
and you can't approve the tide
no!
we bid you welcome to a pageant of anomaly
we deliver disarray
you fail to tell
perception from reality
but what's the difference anyway?
the devil you don't know sure ain't wornout

out of the dark into the fire below
drawn to the light
you see that everyone's the only
and the choosen one
a single drifter in the flow!
in search of light they would
approve to sacrifice the sun
and say: "it's just the way things go"
the sabre in one hand,
the torch in the other
sharpen your wits!

waiting up all night
i am lying by your side
i can't close my eyes and slowly dream away
i so need to feel you near
the sight i'd see, the breath i'd hear
watching till the break of day
long cold nights
i had to stumble through in a lonely life
wind and rain till you walked inside
every night without you i'd sail on
don't know how i'd make it through without you
every night without you, my angel
pity for the zillions around
who're every night without you
it's not always easy to find the words i need
and tell you all the things i really feel
but watching you beside me
the silence tells the truth
we know that it's forever and for real
long cold roads
i had to stumble down in a long gone life
wind and rain and you walked inside
every night without you i'd sail on
don't know how i'd make it through without you
every night without you, my angel
pity for the zillions around
every night without you
every night without you
i ran around guided by the neon signs
i burned the candle at both ends
why would we die for the things we've never lived to see
striving for peace of mind
solo
every night with...
every night without you i'd sail on
don't know how i'd make it through without you
every night without you, my angel
pity for the zillions around
who're every night without you...
"what a cheek of the gods"
i thought when i'd hit the ground
but now that i'm here anyway  terrestrialbound
i gotta make the most of causing a stir
condescend to save the world
and turn it upside down
i'll shake it till my kingdom come
they call me love tttyger
i'm gonna save your soul  never mine
love tttyger  i'm gonna save your soul
there may be a lot who don't wanna be saved
i'm gonna save them anyway
tonight the love tyger's gonna bite you tonight
tobi or not to be! motowngod, just in white
evel kneevil of rock just without any bikes
i would break my nose to make a stir
break a rib to save the world from choreography
i say a lot i must not say
and yet i get paid quite okay
they call me love tttyger
i'm gonna save your soul  never mine
love tttyger  i'm gonna save your soul
there may be a lot who don't wanna be saved
i'm gonna save them anyway
tonight the love tyger's gonna strike tonight
solo
call me love tttttttttttyger
i'm gonna save your soul  never mine
love tttyger  i'm gonna save your soul
there may be a lot who don't wanna be saved
i'm gonna save them anyway
tonight i'm gonna purr and scratch and bite you tonight
ttttyger
attttttack of the tttttyger
you're wideawake
or is it a trick of the light?
you've been here before
but this is the night
cries of temptation
you're content to lose your way
jolly, what a jolly piece of folly and no way to defy
you can't wait to see what mortals they dare
only to speak about in whispers of the dark
you're on the way that anxious have lost
threatened by sanity
reason laughs with vanity
fiery moon in the sky
you can't wait to face it
your heart is racing
fiery moon paints the sky
you've entered the realms
you've entered the realms of baba yaga
you've entered the realms of baba yaga
razzledazzle
mortar and pestle
will you stand the ferocious look?
deafened by the yelling
from a chicken legged dwelling
frightening and earthy to those who ain't worthy
they won't stand the madness
and the ambiguity of her mind
unravel the mystery of you will be history
you will be wined and especially dined
you can't wait to see what mortals they dare
only to speak about in whispers of the dark
you're on the way that anxious have lost
threatened by sanity
reason laughs with vanity
fiery moon in the sky
you can't wait to face it
your heart is racing
fiery moon paints the sky
you've entered the realms
you've entered the realms of baba yaga
the realms of baba yaga
baba yaga tells me:
will i have to dine with you tonight?
solo
what's this about for heaven's sake
you wanna turn but it's too late
your will is morphing into mania
hahahahahahahaha
this ain't no fantasy no more
senses your commands ignore
just like the spirits that you've cited
baba yaga
you've entered the realms of baba yaga
you've entered the realms of baba yaga
you've entered the realms of baba yaga
you've entered the realms of baba yaga oh
oh baba yaga
oh baba yaga
oh baba yaga
oh baba yaga
you're letting go and try to fly away
to the slumberous voice of pouring rain
the inner agitation's dancing in your head
will it ever end?
you're all alone with coloured memories
ungiving hotel without company
the ringing in your brain it starts to fade away
fade away
are you insane?
walls come down
and then a ghostly voice
it sets up crazy moans into the night
time and time again...
and you don't have a choice
but lie awake to verify
did she really say
"now do me! do me like a caveman"?
it feels like no one's ever there when you're in need
and no one's ever gonna try to believe
the unforbearing walls are living to let it through
whispering ghostly  right to you
walls come down
and then a ghostly voice
it sets up crazy moans into the night
time and time again...
and you don't have a choice
but lie awake to verify
ground is shaking
the earth is quaking
and nobody's here to testify
ghostly whispers in the night:
"do me like a caveman!"
walls come down
and then a ghostly voice
it sets up crazy moans into the night
time and time again...
and you don't have a choice
but lie awake to verify
ground is shaking
the earth is quaking
and nobody's here to testify
ghostly whispers in the night:
"don't waste time to hold me tight
like a caveman push inside!"
ghostly whispers in the night:
"don't waste time and come inside
like a caveman take a ride!"
an ocean of stars gleaming like diamonds
how many times have we wondered what lies behind
and how do you wish to make explorations
and travel through space and time
to the crest of forever
shoot up to life out there what will it be like?
and if we're much faster than light maybe i can see
what the shine of my ego looks like from a distance
and what do they know about me in faraway solar systems?
oh i dive in zero gravity
a glance at the all
we're riding out, pass by the moon
bird's eye view on the universe
we're all about breaking the rules
"freeze!" goes the space police
"you're all about to make a fool of yourself"
goes the space police
cause you're about to negate their rules
they're the space police
your visions caught speeding
by free spirits that you recognize by the look
spacetrotting dissident freedom police
contrarians by the book
freedom and wisdom they guard from outside
stars and infinity shaking their heads at the force
into the black hole
oh what looked like zero gravity
is just a gelatinous mass
we're riding out, pass by the moon
bird's eye view on the universe
we're all about breaking the rules
"freeze!" goes the space police
"you're all about to make a fool of yourself"
goes the space police
cause you're about to negate their rules
watch out for the space police
space police
get me back on the straight and narrow
space police
law and order at the border to infinity
space police
aaaaaah
aaaaaah
ahhaaahaaahaaaa aaaaahaaahaaaahaaaahhaaa
aaaahaaaa hahahaha aaaah aaaahahaaaaaa
aaaahaaahaaa aahaaaaaaa

shoot shoot ... shoot tilt
so many days we've spent together
trying to get ahead with our dreams
now we have come to the goal forgotten
hurting within left us torn
the road is open
we find out way through ties where broken
so the means to the end
was the peace that was meant
to be ours since it all began
we fight to win
i won't give up, we'll fight to win
to move along from where we'd been
i'll sing this song for you again
i'm looking up around the bend
we're so much stronger than before
our fraying edges on the mend
life as we know would be so different
had our paths continued the same
seizing the day with all that's offered
the good and the bad,
the clear and the haze
to move along from where we'd been
i'll sing this song for you again
i'm looking up around the bend
we're so much stronger than before
our fraying edges on the mend
don't let go
so hard to face what we've done wrong
we shared a life that can't be
we cannot hide from destiny
so hard to face what had gone wrong
we've got to make this work
and give it our all
give our all and won't let go
waiting so long for an answer
we've been waiting oh, so very long and
now we're ready to accept our fate
our melodies will be remembered
forever and ever
our memories will fade away
when the leaves have reached the soil
i won't give up this fight
the sacrifices made
we gave our all
and won't let it go to die in vain
i'll sing this song again
we're stronger than before
we have the chance of lifetime
we'll never close this door
can't move an inch
but for the act to
leave fingerprints
freedom farewell
look in the lens
answer the questions
are you a threat?
nec plus ultra
after all the grabbing, it's time to bite the dust
leave behind the breaches of my trust
cleaning up the mess is up to us
non plus ultra
chorus:
now that all hands are tied
we're panic stricken
wealth out of sight
demolition, the damaged pride
the price of ambition
nec plus ultra
the current system leads to profit seeking deeds
leave behind the traces of our blood
now the course for change is up to us
non plus ultra
chorus:
now that all hands are tied
we're panic stricken
wealth out of sight
demolition, the damaged pride
the price of ambition
access is now denied
we're panic stricken
wealth out of sight
intuition, forgotten guide
the price of suppression
terre eos vi
augearis
perde eos vi
nobis imperium
can't move and inch
but for the act to
leave fingerprints
freedom farewell
look in the lens
answer the questions
will you behave as required?
when we think the end is here
with nearly all faith gone
there is hope along the way
and there a new age dawns
"none are more hopelessly enslaved than those who falsely believe that they are free"
goetho
nobis victoria
non plus ultra
chorus:
now that all hands are tied
we're panic stricken
wealth out of sight
demolition, the damaged pride
the price of ambition
access is now denied
we're panic stricken
wealth out of sight
intuition, forgotten guide
the price of suppression
can't move an inch
but for the act to
leave fingerprints
freedon farewell
look in the lens
answer the questions
will you behave as required?
when we think the end is here
and our faith will disappear
"chasing our addictions we're stunting our growth
once we get rid of this ballast we'll be able to
restore the balance and distribute our wealth"
hiding in a weakness something we can never retain
years of crawl  decay and despair
are we a wrong perception something we can never regainrepair
no one to blame, facing me random
nothing will ever explain, so it reclines
where was i meant to be
i feel i'm lost in a dream
long for the day i can be myself
when will i be unleashed
it's not the way it should be
again and again only to be myself
i see a silhouette, liquid that moves
skin like a pearl in the sea
i cannot resist this, her voice in the wind
but is it my eyes are deceived?
is it you i see?
lie down in my arms
trust what you see
smooth your brow, you will be with me
to find your relief
gazing at whitecaps, coming so close
everything's suddenly clear
numb with the aching, and still i am waiting
the water is pulling me near
would you welcome me?
lie down in my arms
try not to breathe
quiet love, you are now with me
you need no words to speak
born to fight, and we're born to flee
doomed to live on ecstasy
born to lie, and we're born to cheat
look in the mirror, who do you see?
born to flee, and we're born to fight
without your mask, you're terrified
don't hide your personality
that's who you are, your identity
if the virtues of tomorrow
cause the greed of today
we won't have a future
nor liberty
born to breathe, and we're born to pursue
that's all we are supposed to do
the semblance of our liberty
is nothing more than slavery
born to flee, and we're born to fight
is it failure that's our delight?
born to cheat, and we're born to lie
look at yourself, have you lost your mind?
if the virtues of tomorrow
cause the greed of today
we won't have a future
and no more liberty
if the virtues of tomorrow
set the need on the way
we won't have a future nor liberty
private vice leads to public virtue
raised to think that we are free
living in our caves
being slaves
we lost control of our lives
at the mercy of the waves
massive waves
blind to see what's going on
conditioned as we are
and we are
we lost control of our greed
but now we face it all
face our fall
keeping all that we've created
and consuming all that's possible
reaching deep into temptation
nothing can stop us
guarantee our hardearned profits
multiplied tenfold if possible
reaching out for new redemption
nothing avails our needs
my opponent won't rule out raising taxes.
but i will, and the congress will push me to raise taxes and i'll say no.
and they'll push, and i'll say no,
and they'll push again, and i'll say to them,
read my lips
if the virtues of tomorrow
set the need on the way
we never had a future anyway
we had no future 'till today
time and tide
will not wait for anyone
you were always there to hold my hand
when times were hard to understand
but now the tides of time have turned
they keep changing
seasons range, but you remain the same
a steady heart, a sun to rain
you'll be the light that's shining bright
high above me
autumn cold, losing heart
we are leaves meant to fall
there is a meaning to all
that fades
freezing winds were stayed by warming words
to touch your healing to the hurt
i'll treasure every lesson learned
to the embers
fires fail
blushes pale
we will answer the call
there's a meaning to all our
seeds of eulogy
to sow along with dreams
fill the need that can leave us grieving alone
frail is our beauty in the end
but all we count is sentiment
a memory stays to guide the way and whisper
don't lose sight, don't deny
we're leaves meant to fall
there's a meaning to all our
seeds of eulogy
to sow along with dreams
fill the need that can leave us grieving alone
a symphony resounding in our minds
guides us through what we knew
would come all along
sometimes i feel like i don't have the words
sometimes i feel like i'm not being heard
and then i fear i'm feeling nothing more
sometimes i feel i don't want this change
and think we all have to rearrange
and now i feel there's no one losing more
seeds of eulogy
to sow along with dreams
fill the need that can leave us grieving alone
a symphony resounding in our minds
guides us through,
as you hear me
as you do,
as you need me
making true
what we knew would come all along
we're blind and eager
avarice will set us back to blank
those who wager all will have to name a reason
if you can't let go, you will end up empty handed
if you can't control, you'll live your life in vain
who decides about my time to come?
who is able to break through the circle of life and doom?
don't look back
keep on track to break the curse
take the chance
design your universe
we can't undo what we have done
so show us now what we've become
confront us with our viciousness
and our weakness
we can't evade our destiny
so show responsibility
for we all surely have a sense
of our consciousness
to take for taking's sake
will leave a path of loss and strain
and endless breaking of faith can warrant acts of treason
if you can't let go, you will end up empty handed
if you can't control, you'll live your life in vain
who decides about what's true or false?
who is able to sift through the treasures from the flukes?
the time has come, we have to see
that total wisdom is in reach
the time has come to colour in the lines
we must identify the signs
so many people are full of hate
while love and light are in their reach
so many people will harm themselves
but life can be so beautiful
so many people will idolize
while their own success is in their reach
don't forget you're able to
design your own universe
find your balance, sink into rumination
ipsum te reperies
potire mundorum
potire omnis mundi
solve mentem a molestis
mentem ad concretum dirige
unum e jhanas intra
intra unum e jhanas
keep hiding
all colors fading
desiring
they're coming for me
receiving my inspiration
receiving
back in the day, i can recall
that my thist for unclarity and saint
there was no black stain in the walls of my memories
now there's a haste pushing me sideways
and leaving me nothing to gain
taking me back, locking me close in disparity
where was i meant to be?
i'm feeling lost in a dream
long for the day i can be myself
when i'm free
when my sun has set
release myself forever
i have no regrets
to be free
i'm existing again
no, i'm lost endeavors
nothing to concern
when i'm free
call a decline
slowly defines me
is falling away far behind
nothing to keep me with the time
the here and now
where am i meant to be?
i'm feeling lost in a dream
yearning again only to be myself
when i'm free
when my sun has set
release myself forever
i have no regrets
to be free
i'm existing again
no, i'm lost endeavors
nothing to concern
when i'm free
time's just a concept
and always the first thing to fade
no more heartache, no deserving
hiding in weakness
nothing we can ever refrain
years are cruel, they break us
ruling on decay and despair no despairing
cowardice of perception
something we can never repair no repairing
no one to blame
way from the render
there's nothing we'll ever explain
so it remains
where was i meant to be?
i'm feeling lost in a dream
long for the day i can be myself free
when will i be unleashed?
there's nothing i need to be
yearning again only to be myself
free
when my sun has set
release myself forever
i have no regrets to be free
i'm existing again
no, i'm lost endeavors
nothing to concern
when i'm free

we need new drifts, another view
expand our grip on the cryptic soul

death is not the final instance
it's not your time
you have to go back... back!
now!
no, no, i don't want to return,
please let me stay here, don't make me go back
go back, you've got work to do
we're not alone, we are all one.
nothing here will be the same
the smallest bit is as big as nature
our limited capacities
gives us trouble to comprehend
we are linked in every way
and we're strong as our weakest fragment
every word that we convey
is an act with consequences

speaking in degradation
a conversation can take a sudden turn
and reaching the point of violence
because your silence left you without a hand to hold
your past will lead you on to make
making a final judgment
based on your bias will never bring you forward
terror should never guide you
for even the fearful can take a beating in the end
suspicion gets you nowhere
those who denounce a way of life
will stand alone
left to atone their social blunders
if you gun down the messenger
you guarantee that he will be made
into a saint
the martyr of the free word
i will say what i think
i will do what i say
when liberty seems out of reach
we'll fight for our freedom of speech
requiem aeternam dona eis, domine,
et lux perpetua luceat eis
missing a simple context
a mental weakness can throw you out of balance
listen, respect each other
it's not too late for mercy
i will say what i think
i will do what i say
when liberty seems out of reach
we'll fight for our freedom of speech
if we could see ourselves, the mirror would reflect insanity
instead we camouflage the flaws that lie within
condone the suffering we witness as we mingle casually
we need to right ourselves, or else we will derail
aiming too high
you are bound to fail
patience is a vital virtue
that you'll never have
don't force me to believe
we're caught up in the greed
'cause i just care for me
to break it, we'll need everyone
think it through: unite is the only way
a raging tragedy ignored will have it's justice, finally
distress and poverty is everyone's disease
we'll come to realize for all we've done
there is a price to pay
yet hope is never lost, there always is a way
trumping the game
is no easy way
enterprise and discipline
will pay off in the end
if we ever could look into fate's mirror
we would never have ended up here
we're distracted by every sin committed
it should always be ever so clear
if we ever look
we would never be here
don't force me to believe
i'm never needing anyone
i only care for me
i'm thinking through
and mine's the only way
we are caught up
in our failure
now our union
is our savior
it's the only way
if we ever
we would never
if we're clever
we're together
oh! oh! oh!
ohoh!
ohoh!
deep in the night,
coming the violence
sweet with the danger
i have realize
another law in
another contender
in their right rising
to burn to a cinder
their coming times
awaiting the answers
i never let them strike you dawn
i find to fly in the way
is very away to turn the mind
of a very stranger
until the days is waiting to use

a primal faith no convinced

i need to laid warning and beauty
i never let them strike you dawn
i find to fly in the way

face the faith and bless the fire,
give me answers to my prays
i'll carry on the way to back
give me sign to see you,
never wait, you stand to keep the flame
i never let them stake you dawn,

appearance is deceptive
so perfect in disguise
there's more than what you see
a semblance is protective
a blinder for the eyes
a place to hide and flee
flee and you'll never see
what you're going to be
if you throw away the key
the truth from the past you can't make it last
flee and walk away
from what you are this day
if you are afraid to stay
beyond the shore the sea is filled up
with sentiment and strength
here lie the thoughts imprisoned
a field of forces and laments
how can we hide here
we need to change our ways
how can we tell lies here
we turn our eyes away
from the truth
from the past
you cannot
make it last
if you do not cease to run away from truth
you will never see the shadow
of your dying youth
a faade is what we all possess
but on the inside it stays a mess
superficial changes won't recall the past
don't deny the clock is ticking
and it's racing fast
fading tokens of our latter days
make us think we need to change our ways
deep, the feelings hide
they're wasted from within
and my shell will never break
appearance is deceptive
so perfect in disguise
a place to flee and hide and run away
lift the shadow

living at different paces
evading into various places
my compass has broken
i'm losing the way

in me there's still a place that
fulfils me
a sanctity here that i call home

if i try can i find solid ground?
i follow illusive paths
oh it seems they've been written in stone
and the door to a new life is closing so fast
burning the bridges will not bring me back

if you search for enrichment
and injure others
earning more than you can spend
you'll pass the borders
when you think you've succeeded
but something's missing
means you have been defeated
by greed, your weakness
this fantasy is not enough for me
i want it, i'll take it away from you
your misery that softly incites me
all i do is using, abusing you
life is often miserable
in the search for happiness
the power so desirable
they bring so much distress
life is often pitiful
in the search for blessedness
if we weren't so insatiable
there would be much more than less

how can we let this happen and
just keep our eyes closed 'till the end
the only thing that counts is the prosperity of today
most important to us is that our bills get paid
our good intentions have always been delayed
how can we let this happen and
just keep our eyes closed 'till the end
when we will stand in front of heaven's gate
it will be too late!
try to unlearn all that you've learnt,
try to listen to your heart
no, we can't understand the universe
by just using our mind
we are so afraid of all the things unknown
a must we appease is the lust to get laid
nothing really matters, just devouring our prey
our good intentions have always been delayed so
our generous acts have always come too late
we are so afraid of all the things unknown
we just flee into a dream that never comes true
low to the ground we feel safe
low to the ground we feel brave
oblivisci tempta quod didicisti
open your eyes we're not in paradise
how can't you see, this stress is killing me
fulfil your dreams life is not what is seems
we have captured time
so time made us all hostages without mercy
seemingly generous fooling ourselves,
selfishly venomous time tells
too much thinking goes at the cost of all our intuition
our thoughts create reality
but we neglect to be!
so we're already slaves of our artificial world
we shouldn't try to control life
but listen to the laws of nature
we all think we're generous
but we only fool ourselves
the only thing that matters is
our way and our vision
selfishly we're venomous
but you know the time tells us
there is more to life than our
higher positions, race for perfection
better, faster
we must return to the laws of the nature
free ourselves from madness

when darkness will reign and blind us all
when darkness will reign and blind us all
allegiance will blind us if we do not fall
we cannot tell when morning comes
is there a choice to live another day?
it's hard to find a new direction in your fragile life
the precious time of your existence is now to come
don't throw your life away by cheating time
sugared placebos only fool your mind
now i want the water to wash away all my sins
the wind to blow away my thoughts without meaning
the fire to burn away my thickened skin
when darkness will reign and blind us all
allegiance will blind us if we do not fall
novas portas pandimus
what is the space, the type of dance?
i cannot tell which steps i have to take
i'd like to leave, just run away
my feet are tangled up
so hard to face the pace of the clock
what do you think, will it ever stop?
so will i fall and not get up?
i take it all in stride
now i want the water to wash away all my sins
the wind to blow away my thoughts without meaning
the fire to burn away my thickened skin
everything has a reason for its happening
can't you tell it's your own spell and
everyone has to dance his dance like anyone
can't break free of destiny
we should open new doors
and close the ones that we've left behind
now i want the water to wash away all my sins
the wind to blow away my thoughts without meaning
the fire to burn away my thickened skin
when darkness will reign and blind us all
allegiance will blind us if we do not fall

it feels so warm when you are near
you are all i want to feel
tell me now, is this for real?
it's hard to breathe
we're all lost and travelled high, cannot find my peace of mind
when the sun will rise again, we'll fly away
take the stairs to the stars
wander long, travel far
someday
a summer breeze makes all of our winters freeze
autumn leaves
there's no chance for spring's romance
we linger on but leave the past behind us
old lovers live it all anew
but chances are so few
windows open up to life
put your worries all aside
sacred silence closes doors for opened eyes
take the stairs to the stars
wander long, travel far
someday
always
a summer breeze makes all of our winters freeze
autumn leaves
there's no chance for spring's romance
we linger on but leave the past behind us
old lovers live it all anew
but chances are so few
and choices are so true...

it always put me on the edge,
to think of all the spoilt lives
today i'm one step further
not sure if i've survived myself
reality is sometimes stranger than fiction
whatever happens in my dreams
i know it can't be worse than this
so i prefer to sleep
i am searching
 without vision 
for the answers in the dirt
i am waiting
 just for nothing 
for the day that i'll be heard
you're the sea in which i'm floating
and i lose myself in you
i am feeling these sensations
i communicate with you
i am looking
 without vision 
for a different kind of way
i am thinking
 just for nothing 
about that specific day
you're the night so you're the dark side
of the day you'll never see
you're the past but everlasting
can you share one day with me?
you're the hand that i rejected
but i can't forgive myself
i am selfish and not worthy
to think of, even to die for
reality is sometimes stranger than fiction
whatever happens in my dreams
i know it can't be worse than this
so i prefer to sleep
tomorrow, don't know where i'll be
i need some place to go now
so do you know the way i feel
or shall i give up my belief?
you're the lock i've never opened
'cause i threw away the key
i'm enclosed within my own thoughts
that will never set me free
youre the hand that i rejected
but i cant forgive myself
i am selfish and not worthy
to think of, even to die for
you're the question to the answer
and without there'll never be
any thought in this direction
you've created this in me
youre the hand that i rejected
but i cant forgive myself
i am selfish and not worthy
to think of, even to die for
serenity is taking over all i am, it gives me peace
and all i see are visions of my destiny
why should i bleed and pay for the others' greed?
we consciously sign our own sentence of death
how can you go on, did you forget
what we have learned from the past?
we can't go on killing ourselves
and with us all the rest
why can't you see, don't you regret?
reality is sometimes stranger than fiction
whatever happens in my dreams
i know it can't be worse than this
so i prefer to sleep
i am alone with all my thoughts
alone without a hope and
i lost the thing i needed most
i feel i can't survive this fall

you've got to open your heart
to see the confinement
bewail the truth, the face of fate, and conquer all the past 2x
it seems so futile, forgiveness , your freedom
the present state of veniality
bewail the truth, the face of fate, and conquer all the past 3x
search for the light , and then you'll find
your own peace of mind
midnight
not a sound from the pavement
has the moon lost her memory?
she is smiling alone
in the lamplight
the withered leaves collect at my feet
and the wind begins to moan
memory
all alone in the moonlight
i can smile at your days
life was beautiful then
i remember the time i knew what happiness is
let the memory live again
every street lamp seems to beat
a fatalistic warning
someone mutters and the street lamp gutters
and soon it will be morning
daylight
i must wait for the sunrise
i must think of a new life
and i mustn't give in
when the dawn comes
tonight will be a memory too
and a new day will begin
burnt out ends of smoky days
the still cold smell of morning
a street lamp dies, another night is over
another day is dawning
touch me,
it is so easy to leave me
all alone with the memory
of my days in the sun
if you touch me,
you'll understand what happiness is
look, a new day has began

memory, fading out
its presence still lingers in my mind
listen to your inner voice
there's no escape, there's no other choice
a foolish fate that came about
death could not leave without
don't try to scour your inane soul
it would be labours lost
deep inside hides a lie
where can we try to seek
a way so this will die
innocence died when they took his mind
and they tried to leave him behind
not even a cascade of tears will save you
and keep you away from harm
concinnity of destiny
is not what you wished it to be
deep inside hides a lie
where can we try to seek
a way so this will die
blind by love
between lust and hate
you scarred your fate
there's no time to waste
ride for your own ruin
odium became your opium
please don't let me bleed for all eternity
deep inside hides a lie
where can we try to seek
a way so this...
please leave me be in my own misery
a place we tried to search a thousand times
to finally feel as if forever wasn't ever long enough
i will refrain
i feel a passion watching over me
to shed this pain in me
this evolution will empower me
now truth begins
and you will not find me
i am safe in here
i'm where i want to be
it's a place where our wish will be granted
come, you'll see i'm right
it's a force that will linger within you
dark as day is night
it's a place where your dreams will be sancted
and will always be
it's a force that will send what's within you
just you wait and see
take one step closer to the borderline
when night is taken back
this mortal coil is gone and left behind
on holy soil
and you will not find me,
i am safe in here
i'm where i want to be
it's a place where our wish will be granted
come, you'll see i'm right
it's a force that will linger within you
dark as day is night

it's a force that will send what's within you
just you wait and see

i am safe in here
i am where i want to be

i'm where i want to be!
it's a place where our wish will be granted
come, you'll see i'm right
it's a force that will linger within you
dark as day is night
it's a place where your dreams will be sancted
and will always be
it's a force that will send what's within you
just you wait and see
trees have dropped their leaves,
clouds their waters
all this burden is killing me
distance is covering your way,
tears your memory
all this beauty is killing me
oh, do you care,
i still feel for you
so aware,
what should be lost is there
i fear i will never find anyone
i know my greatest pain is yet to come
will we find each other in the dark

quietus
by epica
the culprit, you act before thinking
caught in your ignorant sin
and lying to your own reflection,
you thought you could hide
deprived of my own innocence, denied
the infinity of recurring torment, your comeuppance
see, hear the torture inside
devouring what was left of my pride
you thought it?s not going to happen to you,
thought you could hide
the infinity of recurring torment, your comeuppance
dwelling in a mind, mixed up and
your regret has spread over the sea
numquam remotiores ab origine
media parte mundi
funditus aberramus
ultimum excidium sui
living at different places
evading into various spaces
my compass has broken
i'm losing the way
an ongoing madness has led me astray
my past breathes down my neck
and it seems now that all i can do is
go back to beginnings when all lay ahead
a fading illusion now plagues me instead
in me there's still a place that fulfills me
a sanctity here that i call home, i run to
when winter descends
if i try, can i find solid ground
i follow elusive paths
oh, it seems they've been written in stone
and the door to a new life is closing so fast
burning the bridges will not bring me back
memory, fading out
its presence still lingers in my mind
listen to your inner voice
there's no escape, there's no other choice
a foolish fate that came about
death could not leave without
don't try to scour your inane soul
it would be labour lost
deep inside hides a lie
where can we try to seek
a way so this will die
innocence died when they took his mind
and they tried to leave him behind
not even a cascade of tears will save you

odium became your opium
please don't let me bleed for all eternity
deep inside hides a lie
where can we try to seek
a way so this
please leave me be in my own misery
can't you hear me screaming once again?
voices you can't hear
because you are consumed and in content
with everlasting greed
don't you see me on my hands and knees?
begging and bleeding
you're smiling as you bite the hand that feeds
but we're not foreseen
always wanting what your eyes can't see
feeling what your arms can't reach
thinking you are in need
always hearing what your ears can't hear
feeling what your arms can't touch
thinking you are incomplete
it was never enough that i gave to you
all of the horror that you've put me through
but i cannot make up my mind this time
this is where i will draw the line
sacrifice my life to be with you
why did you leave me?
there's nothing more from me you can consume
'cause you're incomplete
always wanting what your eyes can't see
feeling what your arms can't reach
thinking you are in need
always hearing what your ears can't hear
feeling what your arms can't touch
thinking you are incomplete
it was never enough that i gave to you
all of the horror that you've put me through
how can i make up my mind this time?
this is where i will draw the line
everlasting greed
would you please answer me?
and make me complete
everlasting greed
would you please set me free?
fulfill all my needs
and make me complete
it was never enough that i gave to you
all of the horror that you've put me through
how can i make up my mind this time?
this is where i will draw the line
never again will i be with you
not promise
i finally made up my mind this time
this is the end
i've drawn the line
never enough to devour your greed
ticktock goes the clock as time is passing by
don't you know this moment will exist and fade to black
when we look back upon mistake
we're trying to find a way
never let the sticks and stones break bones and beat us through
i remember the light
turn our world upside down
reflecting on the many years
that passed us by
once every now and then we hide inside
to grasp reality and let our light shine through
we welcome to end raids and rising tides
and the darkness that surrounds us turns to light
good bye, we'll always say that balance will remain
point the key of might to opened doors and disengaged
when we all enterprise and find the key to survive
unlock the secrets of the heart and memories
once every now and then we hide inside
to grasp reality and let our light shine through
we welcome to end raids and rising tides
and the darkness that surrounds us turns to light
mindless will show you now
and never reside
there is the different way
inflame your energy
it's hurting
believing
your preaching
said all been paid
once every now and then we hide inside
to grasp reality and let our light shine through
we welcome to end raids and rising tides
and the darkness that surrounds us turns to light
take it for the anniversary era
out of our sight
your eternal my love.
for me your all there ever was.
every limit overcome.
as we are tangled we are one.
words are left unsaid, burning in my head.
now i only wish i could hold you again.
being there with you, i feel at ease.
being there with you is all i ever need,
my one believe, we share a common energy.
i've flown a far beyond the sea,
to find the other side of me.
i've waited long and patiently,
to find the one to balance me.
to live without,
this is my common entity.
life feels empty my love,
it pains me so to give you away.
sentence untold never to unfold.
now i only wish i could hold you again.
being there with you i am whole again.
being there with you is all i ever need,
my one believe, we share a common energy.
i've flown a far beyond the sea,

to live without this is my common entity
my one believe.
you're all i need, my one believe.
the winds of time will carry me.
to live without
don't let this out.
never could we see
what lies deeper
seeming that our view
can't be changed
deciding where to go
and believe in your disaster
deleting a future untold
this is the final deceiver
this is the devil in me
expecting deeds in the making
will show no final relief
ever would we dance
with the reaper
seething in a monstrous cage
ideas meant to placate
when meeting your disaster
are only for a desperate fool
destructive thoughts to mislead us
can come from deep underground
believing sources unbroken
will tear the legion apart
will we be forever free as we unchain our souls
from life forever
you are just a slave to the dust
another time, where you and me will be freed
with one more last endeavor
you cannot escape your fate now
no
try me, don't deny me
please embrace me in your peace
i want to fly into the bright
would you pleas guide my last goodbye
why won't you lie with me, my light's ending
on a night when i find, i'll take my final flight
now come and see divinity where night turns day
so far away from heaven
you will never earn my trust
provoke the need, give word to deed
and dive into another godlike atmosphere
you will never find you way out
no
try me, don't deny me
please embrace me in your peace
i want to fly into the bright
would you pleas guide my last goodbye
why won't you lie with me, my light's ending
on a night when i find, i'll take my final flight
i'd rather die
than breathe in my shame
they'll know my name
all hell in flames
for our faith
we proudly die
for it we would die
for our sovereign
all hell will arise
we'll serve our cause
in earning reward
collision of skies
the ocean wept dry
every ocean dry
another's desperation flying through the emptiness
as my degradation throws me out of line
take the final flight
into the serenade forever lost in time
try me, don't deny me
please embrace me in your peace
i want to fly into the bright
would you pleas guide my last goodbye
why won't you lie with me, my light's ending
on a night when i find, i'll take my final flight
chance doesnt exist but the path of life is not
totally so predestined and
time and chronology show us how all should be
in the ways of existence to find out why we are here
being conscious is a torment
the more we learn is the less we get
no one surveys the whole, focus on things so small
but lifes objective is to make it meaningful
searching only for this that which doesnt exist
although our ability to relativize remains unclear
being conscious is a torment
the more we learn is the less we get
every answer contains a new quest
a quest to nonexistence, a journey with no end
im not afraid to die
im afraid to be alive without being aware of it
im so afraid to, i couldnt stand to
waste all my energy in things that do not matter anymore
our future has already been written by us alone
but we dont grasp the meaning
of our programmed course of life
we only fear what comes and smell death every day
our future has already been wasted by us alone
and we just let it happen and do not worry at all
our future has already been written by us alone
but we dont grasp the meaning
of our programmed course of life
we only fear what comes and smell death every day
search for the answers that lie beyond
being conscious is a torment
the more we learn is the less we get
every answer contains a new quest
a quest to nonexistence, a journey with no end
a place we tried to search a thousand times
to finally feel as if forever wasn't ever long enough
i was afraid
i feel a passion watching over me
to shed this
this evolution will empower me
now truth begins

it's a place where your wish will be granted
come, you'll see i'm right

black was the night when i did surrender
i did give in to my weakening side
now that i'm empty, my dreams once were many
souls bid a cry to unleash the divine
when you think there's no way out
and all you see collides
hope will in the end chase all your fears away
fighting the source was not recommended
trails of a wish were the hope to survive
skins full ablazing, release crystal gazing
all of it led to a deeper demise
when you think there's no way out
and no one comprehends
hope will show your smile again
what i left behind,
another night of weary dreams
what's been left behind,
another time where days of late are far away
far away
losing my reasons, no lies to believe in
left the obscure to the means of escape
core has been shaking, there's no more pain to break me
time has commenced and i long to awake
when you think there's no way out
leave everything behind
you can live your life anew

another night of weary dreams
what's been left behind,
another time where days of late are far away
far away
dark days behind me
won't ever break me now

you'll be alone again
no more refusal
face it , slow down
it is for renewal
and expect no miracles
expect no miracle when you're in an endless fall
no regrets if you're leaving
you're a true deceiver
accept the here and now
or regret will end up
mas of justice, shield of menacing strength
will not bend, only break
can't we respect, can we neglect
no respecting so neglecting
those who are suffering in need of help?
those who suffer, needing our help
you are the one i wouldn't like to become
you are not the one i would like to become
not at all in the end
hear our calling
carry me slowly
in the depths of your life
fear the thunder
free me from barren fields
and grey thunder lies
semblance falling
under the grand facade
the truth loves to hide
can we trust all the facts
and believe that the fancied wise are just and needed?
do we want to rely on the views
of the righteous ones who are succeeding?
you look all around and you see
all the things that are not meant to be
then you know it's time to let them go
to let them go
nos docti
sed plus scimus
non sperentes
quod dicunt alii
follow your common sense
you cannot hide yourself
behind a fairytale forever and ever
only by revealing of whole truth can we disclose
the soul of this sick bulwark forever and ever
forever and ever
indoctrinated minds so very often
contain sick thoughts
and commit most of the evil they preach against
dont try to convince me with messages from god
you accuse us of sins committed by yourselves
its easy to condemn without looking in the mirror
behind the scenes opens reality
eternal silence cries out for justice
forgiveness is not for sale
nor is the will to forget
follow your common sense
you cannot hide yourself
behind a fairytale forever and ever
only by revealing of whole truth can we disclose
the soul of this sick bulwark forever and ever
forever and ever
virginity has been stolen at very young ages
and the extinguisher loses its immunity
morbid abuse of power in the garden of eden
where the apple gets a youthful face, a youthful face
eternal silence cries out for justice
forgiveness is not for sale
nor is the will to forget
follow your common sense
you cannot hide yourself
behind a fairytale forever and ever
only by revealing of whole truth can we disclose
the soul of this sick bulwark forever and ever
forever and ever
eternal silence cries out for justice
forgiveness is not for sale
nor is the will to forget
you cant go on hiding yourself
follow your common sense, you cannot hide yourself
behind old fashioned fairy tales
follow your common sense, you cannot hide yourself
and keep washing your hands in innocence
i. impasse of thoughts
i can't see you, i can't hear you
do you still exist?
i can't feel you, i can't touch you,
do you exist?
the phantom agony
i can't taste you, i can't think of you,
do we exist at all?
ii. between hope and despair
the future doesn't pass
and the past won't overtake the present
all that remains is an obsolete illusion
we are afraid of all the things that could not be
a phantom agony
do we dream at night
or do we share the same old fantasy?
i am a silhouette of the person wandering in my dreams
tears of unprecedented beauty
reveal the truth of existence
we're all sadists
the ageold development of consciousness
drives us away from the essence of life
we meditate too much,
so that our instincts will fade away
they fade away
what's the point of life
and what's the meaning if we all die in the end?
does it make sense to learn or do we forget everything?
tears of unprecedented beauty
reveal the truth of existence
we're all pessimists
teach me how to see and free the disbelief in me
what we get is what we see, the phantom agony
iii. nevermore
the lucidity of my mind has been revealde in new dreams
i am able to travel where my heart goes
in search of selfrealisation
this is the way to escape from our agitation
and develop ourselves
use your illusion and enter my dream...
quaestio nostra est aeterna
ultima requies fons vitae
sed eam ut novam ducemus
we will never know all possibilities to predict what is to come
and so we have illusions to think freely
once we had been
rich from within
did not try to reach
what we couldn't achieve
because once we had been
able to win
from the need to succeed
we need to be innocent to live the life we've lived for so long
we need to be blind enough to live the life we live right now
who possesses your time also possesses your mind
once we had been
rich from within
did not try to reach
what we couldn't achieve
because once we had been
able to win
from the need to succeed
we need to be innocent to live the life we've lived for so long
we need to be deaf enough to live the life we live right now
reach out, touch infinity
life is just a memory
time is not the entity
like it used to be
the divine conspiracy
opens up the reality
time is not the entity
like it claims to be
once we had been
rich from within
did not try to reach
what we couldn't achieve
because once we had been
able to win
from the need to succeed
we need to be innocent to live the life we've lived for so long
we need to be insensitive to live the life and so ignore it all
who possesses your time also possesses your mind
who possesses your time
mislead us all, we are not in control
also possesses your mind
there is no trace that will lead to this place
reach out, touch infinity
life is just a memory
time is not the entity
like it used to be
the divine conspiracy
opens up the reality
time is not the entity
like it claims to be
desperately we all
clutch at the last straw
we stumble and fall
countdown to die
to heal it all
we will never reach
our capacities, no more
we cannot expand
our boundaries
once we had been
rich from within
did not try to reach
what we couldn't achieve
because once we had been
able to win
from the need to succeed
we need to be innocent to live the life we've lived for so long
we need to be insensitive to breathe so we can take it all for granted
reach out, touch infinity
life is just a memory
time is not the entity
like it used to be
the divine conspiracy
opens up the reality
time is not the entity
like it claims to be
trying to keep myself afloat upon this stream
but a thought is pulling me down
pulling me all the way down
we are wandering towards a blank infinity
and extinguishing will now be the only way
to diminish your sins
this vortex can't be filled up again
a hole in space and time
do you cry to the heaven's high
when you're confined in here?
do you not ever wonder
why these leaden tears will never dry?
they'll leave behind so many shadows in my mind
high in the sky, all of the clouds are passing by
wait for this storm, wait for the rain,
and wait for the tears to fall down on me
do you cry to the heaven's high
when you're confined in here?
do you not ever wonder
why these leaden tears will never dry?
they'll leave behind so many shadows
living in me, living in all the memories in my life
do you wonder why
these tears never dry
time forced into life
living in my mind
can we ever find a way in t his labyrinth without end?
labyrinth has no end
which turn should i take?
left or right?
should i stay?
should i be the one?
do you cry to the heaven's high
when you're confined in here?
do you not ever wonder why
this leaden tears will never dry
they leave behind so many shadows
this substance in time forced into life
still exists because it's here
living in me, living in all the memories, in my life
lost inside blank infinity
free my mind
heal my scars
erase the past
dark days to forget
and memories to last
in my heart
free me now
make me forget
and forgive
there's no use
to go on and live
show me a way
to the sun
heal my scars
nothing will be forever gone
memories will stay and find their way
what goes around will come around
don't deny your fears
so let them go and fade into light
give up the fight here
let my eyes take in
the beauty that's here
that's left on this earth
my ears long to hear
a melody
give me sight
nothing will be forever gone
memories will stay and find their way
what goes around will come around
don't deny your fears
so let them go and fade into light
give up the fight here
poison is slowly seeping through my veins
stealing the only dignity in me
i pick them up and let them fall
to cause your pain and hit them all
grunts
one more life to live is what i want
i'll take the joy away from them
see to it, they will all be damned
one more chance to heal what i have harmed
the dragon is wreak havoc in my brain
plays my emotion, a never ending game
nothing will be forever gone
memories will stay and find their way
what goes around will come around
don't deny your fears
so let them go and fade into light
give up the fight here
one more life to live for me
i want the night just to color the day
the morning to chase all my nightmares away
don't you deny that we're all human beings
we all have our flaws that can make ourself obscene
obscene
give me what i want
give me what i need right now
that's what i want
that's what i need, get it!
dolendo novit mortalis vitam
tell me what i want
tell me what i need right now
that's what i want
that's all i need, cure me
dolendo discit mori mortalis
losers
nothing will be forever gone
memories will stay and find their way
what goes around will come around
don't deny your fears
so let them go and fade into light
give up the fight here
fireflies are flying higher
they draw their wings up in the sky
something i cannot read now
for my vision is blurred
we are all ruled by our fears below
higher high
we are stuck and can't get out again
there's more than we deny
and there's more than meets the eye
fortune, fairytales we've all been told
our pattern, never built, never begins
i can tell you there can't always be
a happy end to every tale
we are all ruled by our fears below
higher high
we are stuck and can't get out again
there's more than we deny
and there's more than meets the eye
we are all breathing the same air
that we share
we all just have to live
we are all equal
no matter black or white
we are all ruled by our fears below
higher high
we are stuck and can't get out again
there's more than we deny
and there's more than meets the eye
long time, no see, i'm doing fine,
yeah, thank you
that's nice, you look great, don't wanna know
what i go through
hard times, much pain, you will never know,
no one ever does
i stay cool, will act tough, i'll smile along
for you 'cause
nothing's wrong....except for me falling apart
nothing's wrong....it's tearing pieces of my heart
nothing's wrong....except for me falling apart
nothing's wrong....but i fell down right from the start
let's laugh, let's drink, let's just pretend
that i feel good
but at night, it gets to me, hits me like
a piece of hardwood
it's wrong, i feel fucked, can't play the clown
no more, no
i quit, find help, i'm getting out of
my own freakshow
nothing's wrong....except for me falling apart
nothing's wrong....it's tearing pieces of my heart
nothing's wrong....except for me falling apart
nothing's wrong....but i fell down right from the start
big boy is calling out for help
big boy is calling out for help
join my journey
come on, take a ride
walk with me through the valley of fear
nothing's wrong, i'm doing fine
nothing's wrong, nothing is....
memories that fade away
have not left their mark
but to live on every single day in many different ways
it's the truth between his cunning lies
that hands him his acho suspicious alibis
persuading with your forms will never be the way to our destiny
suddenly we've lost the forms
to close our cursed wombs
no one seems to realize that wolves are in disguise
your engine was so strong
but the road was just too long
hope is not the end
so never lose the faith
as long as we can say
they can never take away
our freedom the most precious thing we've ever had
the reward from the blood we've ever shed
his quest for higher truth
life of eternal youth has just begun
in spite your way along the road
many virgins wait for him to come
persuading with your forms will never be the way to our destiny
our destiny
there is no love!
no love!
i am a duplication
innocently
i was conceived
so violently
there was no love
there was no love for me
there was only hatred
i am rape
i am hate
i am rape
i am hate
every day i feel anonymous hate
forever in the shadow of disgrace
i am rape
i am hate
i am rape
i am hate
i am so filled with pain
a bruised and darknened soul
spare me from the
life that's full of misery
i don't want to live that
way!
i don't want to live that
way!
there is no love!
every day i feel anonymous hate
forever in the shadow of disgrace
i am rape
i am hate
i am rape
i am hate
i am so filled with pain
a bruised and darknened soul
spare me from the
life that's full of misery
i am so filled with pain
a bruised and darknened soul
spare me from the
life that's full of misery
i don't want to live that

x3
i am so filled with pain
a bruised and darknened soul
spare me from the
life that's full of misery
spare me from the
life that's full of pain
spare me from the
life that's full of pain
i don't want to live that
way!
don't believe what you see
believe in me and my reality
i am a man of god
god, can't you give that i am begging you
don't believe what you hear
believe in me and i will reappear
salvation here at last
at last, i want you, answers all my questions
is a desert running dry
deep inside
you refuse to face the facts
but pray for life
find salvation's in this phrase
we will wait for the day
you began ending a way
don't believe what you see
believe in me and my reality
infinity in me
this is the end all and be our last hope
is a desert running dry
deep inside
you refuse to face the facts
but pray for life
find salvation's in this phrase
we will wait for the day
you began ending a way
domine jesu,
demitte nobis debita nostra
salva nos ab igne inferiore
perduc in caelum omnes animas
praesertim eas, quae misericordiae tuae maxime indigent
in nomine patris, et filii, et spiritus sancti
amen
give me our lie
you and i will devour,
our senses bring us to forget
children, sons and you have seen
and our cross, it gives us hope
is a desert running dry
deep inside
you refuse to face the facts
but pray for life
find salvation's in this phrase
we will wait for the day
you began ending a way
and we wait for the day
to discover there is no way
i can't wait and this play
is the bitter way to wait to end this lie
compulsive expressions of your social weakness
vented on your countless made up enemies
i cannot know how you feel
when you don't say anything
chorus
we don't care what you say
we'll never join the games you play
we won't bleed for all your sins
we never followed your way now so
we don't care anymore
how you'll perform your last encore
your misplaced sense of superiority
the result of your unbearable form of vanity
i cannot know what you see
when you don't show anything
chorus
i cannot know how you feel
when you don't tell anything
i cannot know what you see
when you don't show anything
chorus
dominus sum rerum gestarum mearum
heresque sum rerum omnium a me gestarum
ortus ex
natus ex
meis factis
sum coniunctus cum meis gestis
meis gestis sum affirmatus
tale monacho revolvendum est
adiutus his vivo
when silence betrays
we've tried to find a reason
to go on and cross the line
tell me
how can we justify the act
we've tried to look around and
search for ways to shift the blame
the escape
from moral sense we drift away
when we can't have it all
we want it all
with money segregating
the centers are degrading
the devastation
we feared we'd befall
but soon we'll realize that
we can get reunited
this could apply to us all, after all
we'll never find our peace of mind
if we don't leave the past behind
make up your mind
when silence betrays
we spilled the tears for wretches
and for human sacrifice
look at them
we've pushed them through the tiny holes
yet still we know we're all responsible
counting down
the reaodroad to perdition
driving fast and without vision
parva notes circum te
incorrupta nitidaque
vide, gusta, senti, bibe
formam ex eis captes
we're falling we're ailing
collapse is now drwaing nearer
derailing, the end is nigh
unravelled, dishvelled
the answer's never been clearer
unlevelled we're standing by
when we finally find the reason to exist
we will be able to appreciate the fundamental gifts
drown, bury, erase
all that is dividing us
down, parry, negate
all that's keeping us from growth
free the energy enclosed within us
try to keep on searching for the meaning of our lives
find the only values that can help us in our strife
keep on searching and be ready when the tides are high
try to find the philosopher deep within you
trigger and motivate all that matters along your way
seek and find the answers
wake up your troubled mind
stay the course
unregarded what the others think
follow through your goals
stay the course
be impassive what all the others want
go your own way
stand focused, stay strong
stay the course
and regardless what the critics say
seek your golden road
stay the course
be hard and fast
reach out, achieve your goals
chase your own dreams
stay faithful, prolong
veils that cover the sacred treasures
that no one dares imbibe
those proclaiming different views
were long ago proscribed
i should warn you, it's deadly to abide
instead i taught you to bow and toe the line
fear is what you breathe
disagree
guidance what you need
for all the chances you will never see
trust in me!
notice the anomalies
erase them from your memory
fight, dismay,
deny the disarray!
just keep them far away from you and fight
with all your might!
stay the course
show no remorse
terminate all that deters
i should warn you to never compromise
instead i want you believing the disguise
we have to wait
for a dying day
full of black decay
we'll find a way
to become aware
breathing tainted air
we change the lanes
in every second of our lives
we lost our minds
we'll taste the water brine
all for the silver shine
can't stay the same
should end this bloody game
bare in the venom rain
to fuel the greed to feed the hungered has it's price
there's the feeling once again
the day where black and white began
await the ending of our everlasting violence
we've all been healing from the pain
from all the misery and constraint
we're inhaling fumes again
so don't deny it
lies will unwind
the verity you'll find
upon the moor resigned
primary gain
comes with a thousand slain
all for the greater vain
without the horror causing hazard we'll survive
whatever lies ahead
we will face tomorrow
then every all delusions end
all of this was foreseen
give in
have to break the chain of grief
you
born to be free
you decide
all are free
time to chance
nothing or all
the clock is racing on
the pace is very strong
our borrowed time is gone
the dawn of sharing all our power has arrived
we're all inhaling fumes again
and there the black and white will end
would anybody dare to know the answer?
would anybody dare to face the truth?
we bide the time awaiting our answers
to our kind
we're all in this apocalypse together
the horror we so feared can't be undone
we all remove allegiance to disaster
tragic crime
life we used to know
ends where silence comes to us forever
night will soon bestow
justice on a day that never ends
the piercing eyes of bullets' shine run faster
than peace and understanding can conceive
to use and to deceive to teach a lesson
cross the line
i'm a true believer
a soldier with a gun
i shall swipe the earth clean
won't take long
te deplangemus
haud resistentes
a te vexati
manebimus
i must trust my instinct
and act on his behalf
my ship is full with water
but won't go down
whenever stories are prescribed
that we could never obelise
then how could anyone supply a doubt
i take you at your word
but the tale could have a flaw
and if you find yourself in awe
then you'll only hunger for the truth
veritas numquam vincitur ipsa
ne qua dicuntur imprudenter credas
when i'm crucified, taunted and denied
i'll stand strong, with my back against the wall
at times it seems so very hard
all that we learned we must discard
that everyone you'd ever trust has lied
when i'm crucified, haunted and defied
i belong to the few that died for all
you cannot question or defy
or you'll find out the hard way why
you'd better run before you walk alone
veritas numquam vicitur ipsa
ne quae dicuntur imprudenter credas
sed tua teneas
sanguis meus tibi non iam perbibendus sit
macula aeterintatis
numquam detergenda
quisnam surget et deteget
imaginem veritates ?
people created religious inventions
to give their lives a glimmer of hope
and to ease their fear of dying
and people created religious intentions
only to feel superior and to have a license to kill
our desire to die is stronger
than all your desire for life
there is no getting away from it now
only true faith survives
people created religious inventions
to give their lives a glimmer of hope
and to ease their fear of dying
and people created religious ascensions
to subject the others and to enslave, just to further enrich themselves
it doesn't matter where we die
it doesn't matter that you cry
we'll take you with us
a disgrace on the beyond
o servator, sempiterne
te grati coluimus, odor atrox quo nons superfundis intolerabilis est
deceive yourself by yielding
to soft words that cause no pain
enrich yourself with different views
learned without disdain
a disgrace on the beyond
that can never be undone
who shall rise and unveil
the facade of reality?
is there still room for new dents in old wrecks?
a disgrace on the beyond that can never be undone
deceive yourself by yielding to soft words
enrich yourself by making up your own mind
sanguis meus tibi non iam perbibendus sit
the origin of a dogma
placed in a new millennium
vilified demons have been embraced
and given a warm welcome
the seif al din
hasn't got the ghost of a chance to rust
because it has always been kept in shape
in serving th one almighty
the rudiments have always been misinterpreted during history,
despite the good intentions of many disciples who's faithful believe was strong and unswayed.
most leaders interpret the old words to their
advantage in the attempt of gaining leadership and power
over those unfortunate enough to fall under their maliciousness and manipulative ways.
this misuse of trust will forever stain the pages of history,
echoing the exploitation and the frailty of decent
men carried away by nurtured rancour...
perpetual distrust fed by a belief
in the malevolence of the others
when the beautiful unreality holds out its hand
it's better not to lose yourself in blind faith
la illah illallah, mohammed rasul allah
the very brightest candle of all has been extinguished
smothered by those who could not bear to face reality
every beat of your heart tore the lies all apart
made foundations quiver
every wave in the lake caused the porcelain to break
and i shiver...
the leftover tallow just doesn't contain
all the right answers
under a sea of dust lies a vast wealth of wisdom
an untouched snow turns red
innocence dies
so sweet caress, never long to last!
you entered my soul and gave hope to my life.
so sweet caress, never hope to last!
you left me behind all alone and aghast
capured inside such an austere elysium
imperfect feelings, futile greef
love a device against all solitude
as it all went on, the love became
a field in a dream that once had been real
so sweet caress, never long to last!
destroy this illusion we need a change of fate!
your frantic thoughts are only a condemned cry
primo somniare videbamur
deinde veritas se praecipitavit
i secretly longed for something
which had never existed
first i thought it was a dream
but then it smashed into reality
beautiful on the outside, decayed deeply within
i secretly longed for something
which had never existed
devoted to a body without a soul
numquam non tibi diffidam
do not use the past as an alibi
for all of your deficiencies always standing by
face your negligence, do not fool yourself
shortcomings will soon appear
for weakness shows itself
blind from your success and all of the excess
deaf from the praise you had
don't cry out of self pity in forcing your way through
for i will not be vulnerable to slander made by you
in a misty veil, misplaced
where castles in the air will be no longer seen
as something out of reach
in time the dream will be erased
so many things will never be the way they seemed
and pride will have it's fall at last
her eyes fell while the shame was written on her face
when she realised that her failures
could never be undone again
you did not notice the manipulated hand
that overshadowed your thoughts all those years
that made you insecure
you did not notice the ancient shifting sand
that pulls you down into an everlasting sham
you will never be able to fight
never be able to hide
run for a fall, you'd better run
on the way to sacred shores
and in the arms of the life that we adore
moonlight shows a white design
that's been waiting for a chance to seize a soul once more
sweet lad, o come and join me, do!
such pretty games i will play with you
on a road
changing course
lightning strikes where we depart
an eerie voice as the night embrace the heart
resonating from the life that is moving on
to new windows of the soul
will you, sweet lad, come along with me?
my daughters shall care for you tenderly
hear his mystic voice
i love you, your comeliness charms me, my boy!
and if you're not willing, my force i'll employ
he feeds on stainless souls
we are stuck in the night
ancient power will strike
feel the fire
now run into his arms
leave your shelter behind
we are going to fly
higher than high
we will take on the sky
feel my senses
united by the night
now it's time to close the door
and open up like before
new windows of the soul
the silence of the void
a father's life destroyed
stuck in the night
ancient power will strike
feel the fire
burn inside
run into my arms
leave your shelter behind
we're going to fly
see us fly
and hear our cry
we're out of sight
higher than high we will
take on the sky
feel my senses
out of my sight
but live on in my mind
new windows of our soul
time to break through the anger
hunt down the remnants of the everlasting myth
incinerating hands that touched your graceful face
in their mysterious ways
the scorching scars have left an everlasting visual trace
now they're blinding and rewinding
time to break through the anger
hunt down the remnants of the everlasting myth
cherish your hunger for resentment and dismay
and then come out to play
cascading colors meticulously all washed away
time for choosing not for losing
defying the fire reviving within
time to break through
your walls are soaring high
they are disarranging
the surface on which we build our own lie
time to break through the anger
hunt down the remnants of the everlasting myth
your wish for virtual perfection seems inane
but try and you will evolve
your paragon possessed your inner self to no avail
no more waiting, no debating
defying the fire reviving within
time to break through
your walls are soaring high
they are disarranging
the surface on which we build our own lie
don't throw your life away
remain the same
watch your back, now feel the heat
you've fooled the world one more time
and now that you've seen with open eyes
all of us are incomplete
it's time to break through
your walls are soaring high
you can even try to
break through the perfect state of mind
and now you break through
you'll reach beyond the sky
you should never ever build on the surface made of lies
time to break through the anger
hunt down the remnants of the everlasting myth
divide and conquer
show no mercy
defile the honor
sow discord amongst them all
crucify my faith
we'll set the stage for the last play
you will not hurt our pride nor break its strength
stirring up to hate
you'll fail to practice what you preach
wake the force as we
won't let you crucify our ways
abomination
will enrage them
manipulation
is effective after all
justify yourself
we cannot speak above our breath
i read between these vast adorned lines
justify your acts
the credulous will be our guests
wake the force as we
won't let you crush our selfrespect
highfalutin weaponry
you dictate your recipe for life
seek the mastermind
the one who's always right
we're searching now and endlessly to set us free
seek the mastermind
there's no one you will find
we have to find a way to change our destiny
hate and fear corroded all our hopes and dreams
that's all we have achieved
divide and conquer
spread disease amongst them all
desecrate yourself
yet our duty will prevail
you will not penetrate through massive shields
desecrate yourself
we will harvest all we've sowed
wake the force as we
won't let you steal our own integrity
highfalutin weaponry
you dictate your recipe with lies
seek the mastermind
the one who's always right
we're searching now and endlessly to set us free
seek the mastermind
there's no one you will find
we have to find a way to change our destiny
hate and fear corroded all our hopes and dreams
that's all we have achieved
bleed from greed
we'll succeed in our aim
force the spirit to its knees
dominate humanity
hold yourself accountable
for the mess around us all
running blindly for the fall
we are all responsible
seek the mastermind
the one who's always right
we're searching now and endlessly to set us free
seek the mastermind
there's no one you will find
on this quest without an end, eternally
hate and fear prevented us to reach
what we truly are
nothing really is as it appears
that's all we need to be
abomination
will arrange them manipulation
is effective
don't me merciful
seize them all
idolam kwam creamus alimus, oramus
ferimur simulacris fictis antiquis et futuris
omnia solent fieri
hoc tempore atque nunc et semper
fictie fallimur, non vivimus sine mora
elimina illecebras fugantes nos
vaca a timore et tempore
playing a million pictures in my mind
that travel at the speed of light
been living in a world turned inside out
diving through a sea that is profound
gracing the code above and tasting life
the will options deciphered signs
believing worlds below that crushed mankind
breaking ground within the great design
do not try to defy creation
see the world through the looking glass
within reach is a fading horizon, deep down the flames grow
you may find you're hallucinating
if reality is defied
i can sense the eclipse is rising, showing the blood red moon
this time your mind will find a virtual phantasmic parade
it is a choice that is my own to make
a free will to risk a leap of faith
is it my outcome that i will survive?
finding out my life has been a lie
do not try to defy creation
see the world through the looking glass
within reach is a fading horizon, deep down the flames grow
you may find you're hallucinating
if reality is defied
i can sense the eclipse is rising, showing the blood red moon
this time your mind will find a virtual phantasmic parade
make believers
your divine machinery
not believing
this will seal the deal
seize the liar
selling hollow prophecies
burn the hounds alive
you can watch the world bow down to you
do not try to defy creation
see the world through the looking glass
within reach is a fading horizon, deep down the flames grow
you may find you're hallucinating
if reality is defied
i can sense the eclipse is rising, showing the blood red moon
this time your mind will find a virtual phantasmic parade
do not try to defy creation
see the world through the looking glass
i live to not let go
you may find you're hallucinating
if reality is defied
behold the vertigo
i won't let go
this time your mind will find a virtual phantasmic parade
abandon fear give in before your mind can never escape
we are force to live in silence
eating dust and breathing violence
keeping all the suffering within
let me be the one to hold you
trying hard, remaining hopeful
making sure your heart is free of sin
in mother's scorn
blood was born
where we belong
our nation's torn
passage gone
a war unknown to us all
waiting to see your conviction
swallowing proud premonitions
clinging onto hope that slowly dies
standing in the ruing of nature
caused by forces born from danger
cleaning hands where virtues live on ice
in mother's scorn
blood was born
a war unknown to us all
see the rays of light dance in hurricanes
the essence of our life held within cruel chains
come and see the day's unsolved history
the mirrors in the eyes are reflecting the fear
we can't hide cruel commands
we will see their last stand
from the heart where we belong
forever blind to the wasteland beyond
find security
in this misery
build a world of death
hear the fallen prey
in the fire we've ignited thoughts of slaying dreams
in the ashes evil is reborn
your mortality
is the highest prize
your mind's intricate
in a labyrinth turned inside out
in mother's scorn
blood was born
where we belong
our nation's torn
passage gone
a war unknown to us all
see the rays of light dance in hurricanes
the essence of our life held within cruel chains
come and see the day's unsolved history
the mirrors in the eyes are reflecting the fear
see the sands of time play with prophecies
we always end up losing to life's guarantee
barren promises feed on your demise
the challenge to be free is a lost enterprise
we can't hide cruel commands
we will see their last stand
from the heart where we belong
yet we all know why the cruel commandments came along
forever blind to the wasteland beyond
inhale the strength to play
blow barricades away
this universe implodes
reality unloads
find yourself a thousand worlds
pick the one that suits you most
will a choice put you at ease?
than grab your chance to slay the beast
keep searching for your destiny
and you will find all that will set your free
keep moving onwards endlessly
to evolve and become on
one piece
the universe implodes
when our dream state explodes
find yourself dreaming your life
do you truly feel alive?
comprehend the sacred code
that makes your universe implodes
keep searching for your destiny
and you will find all that will set your free
keep moving onwards endlessly
to evolve and become on
our ego will lead us to endless penance
this journey shall wake us don't dream forever
the matrix of reality transforms the cosmic energy
our ego won't spare us these endless failures
this journey will guide us don't dream forever
rise
nothing appears to be what it really is as we believe in the illusions
free yourself from walking in circles
this will be the end of the world as we know it
your ascension will begin
keep searching for your destiny
and you will find all that will set your free
keep searching for your legacy
and you will find all answers undoubtedly
keep looking forwards endlessly
to evolve and unite the world to become one piece
we cannot be free until wee see
all that we are

this is the time,
we waited too long,
and i am wondering: where i belong?
we have lost we're out of control,
when we fail nature speaks to us all.
this is the time
i'll tell you why the world's left alone,
now's the time to make right what's wrong,
we have lost we're out of control,
if we stray can we hear nature's call?
when we fail nature speaks to us all.
this is the time,
so what's the world to be? just a luxury?
a temporary scene,
but what have we got when is gone away? and
we need to come to see, what the earth should be: a sanctuary free,
a renewed paradise still alive.
this is the time,
the sky and the sea,
we speak the paragons, we planted the seed,
we have lost we're out of control
if we stray can we hear nature's call?
when we fail nature speaks to us all.
this is the time,
so whats the world to be? just a luxury?
a temporary scene,
but what have we got when it's gone away? and
we need to come to see what the earth should be: a sanctuary free,
all that we've sacrificed, in the end has it's price,
a renewed paradise still alive in our eyes
ohhh... vocal
this is the time,
so what's the world to be? just a luxury?
a temporary scene,
but what have we got when is gone away? and
we need to come to see what the earth should be: a sanctuary free,
all that we've sacrificed, in the end has it's price,
a renewed paradise still alive in our eyes
it's still alive in our eyes...
a thousand signs declined
that traveled through light
translate this mystery
that covered my eyes
accept approaching fear
and courage appears
death is a certainty
it's growing near
letting go is fateful
uniting broken rhymes
that visions divide
painting my memories
that colored my life
somewhere safe and sheltered
saved forever
stuck in the light of day
waiting for answers
a seed that grew into branches
another page has turned, ended a letter
come on home and return to the canvas of life
shapes and boundaries
will not disappear
detangle the misery
and enter new spheres
facing right and wrong
while waiting for life
can't change this destiny
the curtain's blose by
while your leaves descended
earth starts to unfold
stuck in the light of day
waiting for answers
a seed that grew into branches
another page has turned, ended a letter
come on home and return to the canvas of life
you're falling down
while my fortune's alive
we're safe and sound on the ground
time to found new memories
the stains come alive where the paint has gone dry
you float above looking down reaching out to me
depicting a beautiful scene that shapes divinity
stuck in the light of day
waiting for answers
a seed that grew into branches
another page has turned, ended a letter
i'll come on home
i'm in the light of day
questions were answered
a new life's arms are extending
the final page has turned, sending the letter
come on home
and i'll sing you the song has painted your canvas of life
o, ne moriar bis
oro supplex
sometimes i feel like my reason is weakinning
my inner clock's forcing time stand till
i'm breaching borders between life and sanity
that's when it all starts to shatter in front of me
liberate me
why don't you liberate me?
sometimes i feel i'm betraying my memory
this time it seems that i'm losing the fight
finding it hard to be consciously part of life
that's when awareness and dreams start to separate
reunite me
it's time to reunite me
as time goes by i hide the truth
cannot stand myself with a broken shell
as time goes by i try to choose
don't know where to roam in this private hell
give me relief
let me believe between sweet fiction and reality
my train thoughts got lost somewhere along the way
i'm chasing shadows that cross on my path
repeating visions that dance faster than my mind
can't stop the rain casting shadows on my parade
can't defeat me
i will not bot to defeat
as time goes by i hide the truth
cannot stand myself with a broken shell
as time goes by i try to choose
don't know where to roam in this private hell
give me relief
let me believe between sweet fiction and reality
my train thoughts got lost somewhere along the way
i'm chasing shadows that cross on my path
repeating visions that dance faster than my mind
can't stop the rain casting shadows on my parade
ne moriar bis
another life, anothe mind close to insanity
another road, a cryptic code the second stone
all the is left is a cross that's mine to bear
a cruse with no ending drenched in anxiety
o, ne discedam bis
oro supplex
as time goes by i hide the truth
cannot stand myself with a broken shell
give me relief
let me believe between sweet fiction and reality
as time goes by i try to choose
don't know where to roam in this private hell
give me relief
let me believe between sweet fiction and reality
ne moriar bis
see through the veil
our perspective on life
defines everything we reach
most of us will aim for
all the certainties
beyond the veil
our perspective on death
can manifest in many ways
some of us stay fearful
til the end of days
as we believe in what we see
we all assume that this is real
our experience will just hamper us
sense without your sanity
we've tried to conceive and intertwine circles
circles of your life
our knowledge will only hinder us
sense without your sanity
we've tried to conceive and interweave the cycles of life
cycles of your life
death will ease us
see through the veil
our perspective on birth
defines how we honor life
an esthetic wonder
blessed with splendid eyes
as we believe in what we see
we all assume that this is real
sense without your sanity
perceive a new reality
your heart is guiding you into
blessedness, we will pull through
the longer you wait for the future the shorter it will be
we're searching for the origin
dig deeper, where we've never been
carry the light, we should cherish the night
the questions that we cannot solve
we don't know how we should evolve
carry the light, we should cherish the night
bring us all to new heights
our feelings are ready to warm us, to finally heat us up
our mind will betray us and leave us in coldness, undefined
our vision of life says what we will experience
our vision of death defines what we will see
beyond the veil
our persperctive on life
defines everything we see
as we all could aim for
a sense of unity
se through the veil
our perspective on death
defines how we spend our days
everyone interprets
things in different ways
as we believe in what we see
we all assume that this is real
sense without your sanity
perceive a new reality
your heart is guiding you into
blessedness, we will pull through
sense without your sanity
a changed mentality
perceive a new reality
don not sppress
your heart is guiding you into
moments of pure blessedness
your words are meaningless, as pain fills the void
hollow words won't hurt no longer
you will regret every life you've destroyed
blaming the whole world will never make you stronger
be prepared for the righteous self
if you blame all your failures on someone else
without any remorse
without your remorse
if you don't face the weakness of your own self
you will take the same course
you'll take the same course
your deeds are reasonless, you adore yourself
empty deeds impress no longer
you will regret everyone you've envied
blaming it on life will never make you stronger
be prepared for the confrontation
if you blame all your failures on someone else
without any remorse
without your remorse
if you don't face the weakness of your own self
you will take the same course
you'll take the same course
if you blame all your failures on someone else
you avoid every chance
you've lost your last chance
to learn from yourself
if you blame all your failures on someone else
without any remorse
without your remorse
if you don't face the weakness of your own self
you will take the same course
you'll take the same course
we can't blame all our failures on someone else
for our own protection
so much to protect
we can't learn from decisions in our own lives
without selfreflection
we will never flee from contingency
we will never flee from contingency
natural corruption
another day passed by in ruined paradise
another night will pass until we're sheltered
we're aiming for a life that won't be compromised
and when we say goodbye it's devastating
now that we have finally realized
realized, petrified
that profit's made from innocent demise
profit's made from tragic demise
another day goes by where money won't suffice
a massive gift was meant as contribution
our conscience comes to aid that ends up in wrong hands
and once the truth's revealed, intent is fading
now that we have come to realize
realized, sanctified
our hearts subdued by all those thousand cries
hearts subdued by all those fierce cries
in moments of deadly gloom
young lives ended way too soon
the facts that are all untrue
spread lies that wew not thought through
fight off the catastrophes
find true inned sanctity
in modern society
welfare is stained, time to come clean again
feast on sheer agone
lean on generosity
pay in full, it all will vanish without care
grant us higher proceeds
we'll ease your mind, guaranteed
we should all be reaching out to the despaired
natural corruption
charity
can you believe it
how nature's left its trace
could we foresee it
what skies erased
we all are trying
we all are dying in nature's arms
in moment of deadly gloom
youg lives ended way too soon
the facts that are all untrue
spread lies that were not thought through
fight off the catastrophes
find true inner sanctity
in modern society
nothing to hide, lives to obtain
welfare is stained, time to come clean again
we're in a time where all enterprises fall
we should beware of the wolves that haunt us
they are not all the same, cannot take the blame
await the time to unchain utopia
am i the only one who sees the troubled lines?
reading illusive writings on the mirror
is there a way that we can all erase mistakes and start anew?
don't mislead us and stop stabbing with blunt knives
liberty unchained
we're in a time where all enterprises fall
we should beware of the wolves that haunt us
they are not all the same, cannot take the blame
await the time to unchain utopia
what is a reason to wreck hopes and all our dreams?
you're leaving endless riddles for the masses
does it make sense to mend the cracks that you hide behind our backs?
it's afflicted by a virus of the brain
liberty unchained
recite the insane
we're in a time where all enterprises fall
we should beware of the wolves that haunt us
they are not all the same, cannot take the blame
we should beware of the lives that are at stake
before it's all too late
can we believe it all?
should we all take the fall?
our backs against the wall
united we stand tall
why should we all believe you?
carry your own burden
we won't succumb to
your delusion now
we're in a time where all enterprises fall
we should beware of the wolves that haunt us
they are not all the same, cannot take the blame
await the time to unchain utopia
why should we all believe you?
carry your own burden
we won't succumb to
your deceiving games
conquer the insane
united we stand tall
time to free ourselves once more from the ball and chain
something is wrong
my strength has gone
thoughts are corrupting my mind
i can see, i perceive this ain't me
something so strong
my mood has swung
i can't get it out of my head
i believe that my mind misleads me
we confuse
is it a doubt you try to hide tangle and abuse
just have an open look inside we appear
it's just a dreary memory stuck in your mind memory stuck in your mind
retrieve your balance
use your senses to observe the essence of silence
search for your essence
find the silence within you the essence is
you're searching and bursting
there seems to be no cure
when tension endures
delusions corrupting my mind
i can see, i perceive this ain't me
there seems to be no way
when light fades to grey
to get them all out my head
i believe that my mind misleads me
we confuse
is it a doubt you try to hide tangle and abuse
just have an open look inside we appear
it's just a dreary memory stuck in your mind memory stuck in your mind
retrieve your balance
use your senses to observe the essence of silence
search for your essence
find the silence within you the essence is
make a start
explore your heart
when a persistent memory
penetrates deep in your mind
allow the silence to destroy
your thoughts in every kind
we confuse
is it a doubt you try to hide tangle and abuse
just have an open look inside we appear
it's just a dreary memory stuck in your mind memory stuck in your mind
retrieve your balance
use your senses to observe the essence of silence
allow the silence
to wipe your thoughts away
retrieve your balance
use your senses to observe the essence of silence
search for your essence
find the silence within you the essence lies in silence
this omen
deceives us
misfortune unites us all
when it seems like the world is shattering
remember that you set your course
when it feels like no one is answering
revert to your deep inner force
as the bell begins to chime
together we'll be strong
to defy all that can't bring us down
united standing strong
you will not fight alone
this omen
deceives us
misfortune unites us all
when it seems like you're always giving in
make sure that you take back control
when you can't stand the world we're living in
remember that you're not alone
as your words are carved in stone
together we'll be strong
to defy all that can't bring us down
united standing strong
you will not fight alone
don't drown in a sea full of sorrow and pain
united standing strong, here is where you belong
your angels will whisper
nothing is what it seems to be
search with your heart and you'll find the key
you'll see
together we'll be strong
to defy all that can't bring us down
united standing strong
you will not fight alone
don't drown in a sea full of sorrow and pain
united standing strong, here is where you belong
this omen
deceives us
misfortune unites us all
disaster
nothing can bring us down
can't beat us
together we stand strong
misfortune
you will not fight alone
can't bring us down
as one we'll overcome
it unites us all in life
all misery we face in life
everlasting nights leave all views behind
limits will become less clear and
a misty memory played out in a dream
this endeavor is causing fear
that's why i can't explain
this is stabbing pain
come undone in nightly rhyming
it's time for me to roll the dice
absent sanctity is shifting gravity
addiction's growing faster, making you go insane
ivory fangs are smiling, you'll have to break the habit
imprisonment's appraoching, catching the savages
the mirror's magic showing chemical insomnia
don't give in to all of this
dive into ecstatic bliss
tame the lion that's hiding the need to be free
waking sunset finds, making restless minds
wistful moments need enclosure
a new hysteria is fading gravity
which is slowly taking over
that's why i can't unwind
all thoughts aligned
floating on rivers that are drying
i fear the beast is rising high
your intuition's fading, a thumping sound impedes
the daybreak is awaking chemical insomnia
don't give in to all of this
dive into ecstatic bliss
don't you believe what the sands of time see
tame the lion that's hiding the need to be free
and the monsters that consume your energy
your barbaric puppets live between the cracks of lies from hate revived
silver secrets shining through the night
an enslaved fool in search of burning light from medicine contrived
golden treasures turning off the lights
forbidden fruit tastes better when it can numb the bran
the outcome of the future is looking quite insane
white bricks and darkened stones are building the fundament
the silence's calling out for chemical insomnia
don't give in to all of this
dive into ecstatic bliss
tame the lion that's hiding the need to be free
and you should not believe what the sands of time see
free the lion that's hiding your identity
fight the monsters that consume your entity
can't move an inch
but for the act to
leave fingerprints
freedom farewell
look in the lens
answer the questions
are you a threat?
nec plus ultra
after all the grabbing it's time to bite the dust
leave behind the breaches of my trust
cleaning up the mess is up to us
non plus ultra
now that all hands are tied
we're panic stricken
wealth out of sight
demolition the damaged pride
the price of ambition
nec plus ultra
the current system leads to profit seeking deeds
leave behind the traces of our blood
now the course for change is up to us
non plus ultra
now that all hands are tied
we're panic stricken
wealth out of sight
demolition the damaged pride
the price of ambition
access is now denied
we're panic stricken
wealth out of sight
intuition forgotten guide
the price of suppression
terre eos vi
augearis
perde eos vi
nobis imperium
can't move and inch
but for the act to
leave fingerprints
freedom farewell
look in the lens
answer the questions
will you behave as required?
when we think the end is here
with nearly all faith gone
there is hope along the way
and there a new age dawns
"none are more hopelessly enslaved
than those who falsely believe that they are free"
nobis victoria
non plus ultra
now that all hands are tied
we're panic stricken
wealth out of sight
demolition the damaged pride
the price of ambition
access is now denied
we're panic stricken
wealth out of sight
intuition forgotten guide
the price of suppression
can't move an inch
but for the act to
leave fingerprints
freedon farewell
look in the lens
answer the questions
will you behave as required?
when we think the end is here
and our faith will disappear
"chasing our addictions we're stunting our growth
once we get rid of this ballast we'll be able to
restore the balance and distribute our wealth"
an overactive mind where a thousand thoughts come floating by
will not be able to slow down at time
don't be afraid, live in the now, enjoy simplicity
avoid incentives that will make you blind
don't let it bur you down
live in the heart
experience the now
to really know yourself, ignore your mind and find yourself again
life is always challenging
to really find yourself, you can't be blind to signals you obtain and gain
thoughts are slowly changing here
here in the now if you identify with your own heart
will change your views and make you feel at home
you're not your thoughts, observe how the can be duplicity
don't follow those that make you drift away
don't let them pull you down
live in the heart
experience the now
to really know yourself, ignore your mind and find yourself again
life is always challenging
to really find yourself, ignore your mind and find yourself again
life is always challenging
to really find yourself, you can't be blind to signals you obtain and gain
thoughts are slowly changing
reward yourself
to really know yourself, ignore your mind and find yourself again
life is always challenging
to really find yourself, you can't be blind to signals you obtain and gain
thoughts are slowly chaging
to really know yourself, ignore your mind and find yourself
life is always challenging
to really know yourself, you can't be blind to signs you gain
thoughts are always ranging now
live the years of danger live on the road
to the point there's nothing to lose
regrets all you want it to be!
in the blink of an eye you're fighting
look at me chump, champ is my name
were you going to all laugh? i'll always be
five times i've died it's all the same
got only myself to blame
never begged for you to rescue me
then again i never could find you
but you leave me ripe to choke
who gives a fuck and your the devil
and now, wont we find out
just how we should get down in hell
funny, you don't seem that big time
memorize that your better
when your smiling pretty for the devil
ten times i've died it's all the same
well i got myself to blame
never begged for you to rescue me
then again no one could find you
because you leave me ripe to choke
who gets the fuck and your the devil
and now, war will find you
this hour, you should live in hell
funny, you don't seem that big time
memorize that your better
when you smile pretty for the devil
yeaw!
uargh!
dear diary, what have i done? am i trippin' or am i alive?

yeaaah! body like a roadmap of pain
oh, yeaah! mind like a landfill of shame
tie my rope one more time
dear diary, had i known what i told you last night

banging my head on concrete wall, while knockin' on wood
thinking it that's gonna do any good when i wake up with
yeaaah!
body like a roadmap of pain
just twice! mind like a landfill of shame
tie my rope
tell me once, i decline, i refuse to learn
shoot me twice but i'm not going down
i will climb the rope you tie for me
beat me up while i'm still alive
tell me once, i decline, i refuse to learn
shoot me twice but i'm not going down
i will climb the rope you tie for me
beat me up while i'm still alive
tell me once, i decline, i refuse to learn
shoot me twice but i'm not going down
i will climb the rope you tie for me
beat me up while i'm still alive
1,2,3,4 and the thrill in the bright sweet night is a question of you
trying to be kicking ass to help me out after you know i never wanna go

the only bottle left to drink again and again
the only try for the fuckin' way to be, why do i slice them out
when together try something drug and you question me what's to coming out

and the turnup in your eyes keep my head
until i sweat now tell me what the fuck to do
one day i gettin' to the point where i can't do,
nothing but try to be strungout on you
let me down, waiting down below.. for the fleeting past to let go
well to the end i raise my better half, pimpin' up my own reflection
forever i saw kissin' you goodbye, to give my soul addiction
before i walk i need the ground
you know me poor, i never return
up and next you tell me fuckin' whore!
the only bottle left to drink before i go
one day i gettin' to the point where i can't do,
nothing but try to be strungout on you
let me down, waiting down below.. for the fleeting past to let go
well to the end i raise my better half, pimpin' up my own reflection
forever i saw kissin' you goodbye, to give my soul addiction
by cryhavoc
i've seen you in a darkness
your face in a dusk
your silhouette in a shades
eyes gliming full of lust
you try to dazzle me with your beauty
you try to bewitch me
when cold northwind blows
i can smell your perfume
when frost bites
i feel your lips on my neck
i don't want to share my life
oh, no with you
i want your sweets and things we used to do
no, you can't reach my love
so go, or be the mistress of my dreams
no, in my life there's no room for you
as you know, your flesh is what i want
i hear your lullaby, ah, that sweet melody
and i can remember those words
which you whispered in my ear
you try to dazzle me with your beauty
you try to bewitch me
i feel your loving embrace
in my dream i see your face
your soft skin under my fingertips
and taste of your lips
i don't want to share my life
oh, no with you
i want your sweets and things we used to do
the time you spend with me
was nothing but a dream
and that's the thing you see
you were the chosen one
we made love under neversetting sun
and that's everything
i could do with you
no, you can't reach my love
so go, or be the mistress of my dreams
no, in my life there's no room for you
as you know, your flesh is what i want
dark desire dressed in black
you try to turn me your back
but you desire me
like a darkness desires you
you try to forget, those times we spend together
but your desire is
what bothers you the most
no, you can't reach my love
so go, or be the mistress of my dreams
no, in my life there's no room for you
as you know, your flesh is what i want
do it, do it end your life
but don't tease me anymore, with your cries, repent
repent
repent whore

the slayings at bodom from so long ago
still carry a secret, of which nobody knows
a seed that was planted as the night turned to dawn
will now bring me to life as the reaper's spawn
i'm a bastard of bodom and i walk alone
as i follow the reaper, to lead me back home
my victims shall perish on the shores of this lake
as they look upon me, to stare death in the face
i don't need a reason, and i won't tell you why
i'll just take you to hell by the edge of my scythe!
i was born to end life, i can take any form
a shape shifting demon, killing for sport
like father, like son, this is my fate
taking your lives and breeding the hate!
i never knew girls existed like you
but now that i do

iron maiden cover
into the abyss i'll fallthe eye of horus
into the eyes of the nightwatching me go
green is the cat's eye that glowsin this temple
enter the risen osirisrisen again.
tell me why i had to be a powerslave
i don't wanna die, i'm a god, why can't i live on?
when the life giver dies, all around is laid waste.
and in my last hour,
i'm a slave to the power of death.
when i was living this liefear was my game
people would worship and falldrop to their knees
so bring me the blood and red wine for the one to succeed me
for he is a man and a godand he will die too.
tell me why i had to be a powerslave
i don't wanna die, i'm a god, why can't i live on?
when the life giver dies, all around is laid waste.
and in my last hour,
i'm a slave to the power of death.
now i am cold but a ghost lives in my veins,
silent the terror that reignedmarbled in stone
shell of a man god preserveda thousand ages
but open the gates of my helli will strike from the grave.
tell me why i had to be a powerslave
i don't wanna die, i'm a god, why can't i live on?
when the life giver dies, all around is laid waste.
and in my last hour,
i'm a slave to the power of death.
pulling the last cry, i was alive alive!
while i'm down in my hatred, weird, right right!
your god has set you on fire, this day the darkness light your way
when we, reach this final dusk
bring me fire and insanity
the jetblack eyes are showing butterflies,
they dance in the fire insane, so
chorus
fire dance with me
fire come with me
fire your fire
of the everlasting flame, did burn me
the one we are all off often struggling down, down, down, down
and when you hear me forth to the ever last,
hear me used to bear dreams cast in a silent near
fire, you're killing me
fire, a thorn, sweet, so rare
we'll praise the lord to begin it
until the others will fall
but, victims are we all
we will at last destroy human gods
and within us the fire is burning
the dream lives forth, we're standing strong to fight
and the everlasting fire is burning
chorus
like i said, i'm ready to go
ease my pain desire
last night i begged to god
light my heart to fire
let me pour some taste down
see my last silent pain desire
let me take a last breath
before i saw, blind my eyes
triple corpse hammerblow
triple corpse hammerblow
don't push me...
don't push me...
don't push me!
let it trust my great vow
life goes away faster
let it trust the meaning
like life it was way before
move away the blow out
like it was by silent bodom
the way it feels, like it feel before
how you feel, feel before!
triple corpse hammerblow
triple corpse hammerblow
don't push me...
don't push me...
don't push me!
there goes the siren that warns of the air raid
then comes the sound of the guns sending flak
out for the scramble we've got to get airborne
got to get up for the coming attack.
jump in the cockpit and start up the engines
remove all the wheel blocks there's no time to waste
gathering speed as we head down the runway
gotta get airborne before it's too late.
running, scrambling, flying
rolling, turning, diving, going in again
run, live to fly, fly to live, do or die
run, live to fly, fly to live, aces high.
move in to fire at the mainstream of bombers
let off a sharp burst and then turn away
roll over, spin round and come in behind them
move to their blindsides and firing again.
bandits at 8 o'clock move in behind us
ten me109's out of the sun
ascending and turning our spitfires to face them
heading straight for them i press down my guns
rolling, scrambling, flying
rolling, turning, diving, going in again
run, live to fly, fly to live, do or die
run, live to fly, fly to live, aces high.
woah yeow
they try kicking and screaming
contation break us apart
in life .....will hold you down
i'm sorry give my life to you
another day you fall and i get away
pushing and screaming cause
they found
hey
take my hand and fly
will you ever be that tall
don't you be afraid
we're not gonna fall
did you think
i'd let you mix it up
give me a reason bitch
you're gonna fuck it up
hey
take my hand and fly
will you ever be that tall
don't you be afraid
we're not gonna fall
hey
do you believe in what we've got
try it, one shot
we stand once and for all
we're not gonna fall
well you thought you had the authority
to slay and kill the minority
together we stand tall
not gonna crash, not gonna fall
did you think i'd let you mix it up
give me a reason bitch
we're gonna fuck you up
it's real, into the charge
at the end we're standing up
out on the street i'm stalking the night
i can hear my heavy breathing
paid for the kill but it doesn't it seem right
something there i can't believe in
voices are calling from inside my head
i can hear them, i can hear them
vanishing memories of things that were said
they can't try to hurt me now
but a shot in the dark, one step away from you
a shot in the dark always creeping up on you
taught by the powers that preach over me
i can hear their empty reason
i wouldn't listen, i learnt how to fight
i opened up my mind to treason
but just like the wounded and when it's too late
they'll remember, they'll surrender
never a care for the people who hate
underestimate me now
but a shot in the dark, one step away from you
a shot in the dark always creeping up on you
a shot in the dark, not a thing that you can do
but just like the wounded and when it's too late
they'll remember they'll surrender
never a care for the people who hate
underestimate me now
but a shot in the dark, one step away from you
a shot in the dark always creeping up on you
a shot in the dark, not a thing that you can do
you know i never
i never seen you look so good
you never act the way you should
but i like it
and i know you like it too
the way that i want you
i gotta have you
oh yes, i do
you know i never
i never ever stay out late
you know that i can hardly wait
just to see you
and i know you cannot wait
wait to see me too
i gotta touch you
'cause baby well be
at the drivein
in old man?s ford
behind the bushes
'till i hear you screamin' for more
down the basement
lock the cellar door
and baby
talk dirty to me
you know i call you
i call you on the telephone
i'm only hoping that you're home
so i can hear you
when you say those words to me
and whisper so softly
i gotta hear you
i feel so lost for me inside,
lost am i, will it never end,
but never am i stained black
now the end is drawing near,
my hate is growing, can't you hear,
it burns me with my cruelty
and i'm off
like the fire of pain in the daylight
full of hate, your hatred gets up doom
chorus
hate, i can't control it anymore,
you'll see the red light more and more
trapping you in destroying despite
by the red light in my eyes
so, better wake up, drink your blood,
follow me and be a god
can't you fucking look into my eyes,
watch this god arise, yeah
come on!
i feel the last one in this time,
lost am i, will it never end
but never am i stained black, jet black
now walk away and flee into hell,
turn away and meet my eyes.
under my, bloodred scythe!
i can feel your hate of death,
i'm running on this darkened little path
take your time, beat me down, sometime, to die die!
chorus
doesn't matter what is on the top, right, way too down below,
that's how the werewolf burns in me
oh god, i see the light again,
i'm gonna be getting someone in my grave
chorus

once a day falling on the trail walking blind
trade nothing descretion in low,
it's hard to wait taking yourself in honor
i should know how low i can go
before i go high i get very down,
and i'll be going after it again and again
you know i can't go the other way
without being trashed, lost and strungout,
when together try something going back to the question
what's to coming out?
before i go high i get very down,
and i'll be going after it again and again
maybe i should've could've trashed my life
but for that i'm gonna turn to you.
and the trashed people askin' my head until i sweat
now tell me what the fuck to do!
one day i getting to the point where i ain't gonna do,
nothing but trying to beat strungout on you
you let me drown way deep down below
for the fleeting past to let go
until the end i raise and batter around
looking at my own reflection
forever i shall kiss you goodbye
to kill my soul addiction
before i go high i hit the ground,
then you know me for i get very down
up to the next you tell me "fucking whore"
and i'll be going after it, before i go!
one day i gettin to the point where i aint gonna do,
nothing but try to be strungout on you
you let me drown way deep down below
for the fleeting past to let go
until the end i raise and batter around
lookin' at my own reflection
forever i shall kiss you goodbye
to kill my soul addiction
by wizzard
gods of thunder, lightning, and rain
lustful succubuses of death and pain
are gathered tonight up in the steel sky
down on the field of battle stand
warriors draped in leather with iron swords in hand
ready to sing their enemies their last lullabies
the sunlight disappears, only torchlights break the dark
depressive silence broken only by hard pounding hearts
mist falls down shrouding the field in mystery
after this night all false metallers will rest in peace
the metal horde raise they swords and hail
iron, steel, metal
iron, steel and metal
sure of they coming victory, they swear on
iron, steel, metal
iron, steel and metal
the massive volume of their chanting, false ears bleed
it's nothing but a massacre when the titans clash with the weak
trying to put us down cries out for revenge
the gods of metal will blow the wimps away
the metal horde raise they swords and hail
iron, steel, metal
iron, steel and metal
sure of they coming victory, they swear on
iron, steel, metal
iron, steel and metal
the metal horde raise they swords and hail
iron, steel, metal
iron, steel and metal
sure of they coming victory, they swear on
iron, steel, metal
iron, steel and metal
the metal horde raise they swords and hail
iron, steel, metal
iron, steel and metal
sure of they coming victory, they swear on
iron, steel, metal
look out !
once again waiting for the darkness, beat up
spun and scarred. preparing for another war.
day by day we decay. sunlight, get out of our way.
dig up yourself from your grave.
bad to the bone, raised in the gutter,
not exactly a muthafucking role model.
to you looking down on me.
fuck you bitch!
ain't got time for the future or the past.
live for the moment, make it last.
as long as the twilight veils
the decadence we embrace
more than the ones we love.
we're ardent, we're burning down...
chorus:
not afraid of crying, sorrow and foe.
not afraid of falling down below.
to the night recklessly we fly.
like living dead, we'll never die
stalling the sandman, fighting back
drinking like a madman, run away from the light to come.
shit falls down!
sun comes up shining bright
time to close your eyes..
chorus:
not afraid of crying, sorrow and foe.
not afraid of falling down below.
to the night recklessly we fly.
like living dead, we'll never die
as long as the twilight veils
the decadence we embrace
more than the ones we love.
we're ardent, we're burning down...
chorus:
not afraid of crying, sorrow and foe.
not afraid of falling down below.
to the night recklessly we fly.
like living dead, we'll never die
you'll take my life but i'll take yours too
you'll fire your musket but i'll run you through
so when you're waiting for the next attack
you'd better stand there's no turning back.
the bugle sounds and the charge begins
but on this battlefield no one wins
the smell of acrid smoke and horses breath
as i plunge on into fucking death.
the horse he sweats with fear we break to run
the mighty roar of the russian guns
and as we race towards the human wall
the screams of pain as my comrades fall
we hurdle bodies that lay on the ground
and the russians fire another round
we get so near yet so far away
we won't live to fight another day.
we get so close near enough to fight
when a russian gets me in his sights
he pulls the trigger and i feel the blow
a burst of rounds take my horse below.
and as i lay there gazing at the sky
my body's numb and my throat is dry
and as i lay forgotten and alone
without a tear i draw my parting groan
i never knew girls existed like you
but now that i do
i'd really like to get to know you
the girl's too young
she don't need any better
it's all coming back
i can feel it
the girl's too young
she don't know any better
it's all coming back
i can feel it
chorus
she is beautiful
she is beautiful
she is beautiful
she is beautiful
the girl is beautiful
you're giving me rules and hints from all sides
and when you hit my back, you rub my eyes
the girl's too young
she don't need any better
it's all coming back
i can feel it
the girl's too young
she don't know any better
it's all coming back
i can feel it
and though i never know you
i look at your face.
to tell you that i love you
don't know what to say
give everything i got to the beautiful girl
the only thing i live for in the whole wide world
chorus
she is beautiful
she is beautiful
she is beautiful
she is beautiful
the girl is beautiful
i ain't got nothing to lose nothing to lose
going to throw it away
and talk to you
she looks good
she looks good
and it's true
and it's true
the girl is beautiful
she is beautiful
i ain't got nothing to lose nothing to lose
when i'm living one time
and i want you
she looks good
she looks good
and it's true
and it's true
the girl is beautiful
she is beautiful
she is beautiful
she is beautiful
na na na na na na na na
she is beautiful
she is beautiful
na na na na na na na na
the girl is beautiful
she is beautiful
she is beautiful
na na na na na na na na
she is beautiful

na na na na na na na na
i ain't got nothing to lose nothing to lose
going to throw it away
and talk to you
she looks good

and it's true
and it's true
the girl is beautiful
she is beautiful
i ain't got nothing to lose nothing to lose
and i'll never forget
when i saw you
she looks good
she looks good
and it's true
and it's true
the girl is beautiful
she is beautiful
looking inside, your future uncertain
the fear grows as a sickness uncured
the silence agonizes, the word sound strong
look inside the eyes, leave this world
hate through the arteries
mass hypnosis
uncertain of being back
they make you feel so good
everything's darkened
obey like a fool
hate through the arteries
mass hypnosis
soldiers going nowhere
believers kneeling over their sins
inhuman instinct of cowardly leaders
make the world go their own way
tens of thousands hypnotized
trying to find a reason why
look inside your empty eyes
obey 'till the fucking end
trapped in the light like nothing was wrong
put the words where i don't belong
now hear the fallen angel
sing my requiem
take a step past the light where i die
flashback and your living in sin
it hurts so bad
like a war within
looking at the blank river of my life
staring out with the evil to my lies
keep the promise if you ever will
just say the word, just kill go kill
wrapped in the edge of my demise
you still cry my final goodbyes
when the years of cold love left their dreadful night
try to move, let me out to my soul
jet black so out of control
so now shout to him in cries
kill them all
looking at the blank river of my life
staring out with the evil to my lies
keep the promise if you ever will
just say the word, just kill go kill
go!
looking at the blank river of my life
staring out with the evil to my lies
keep the promise if you ever will
just say the word, just kill go kill
walked a long long way down there
just to see, feel your glare
i wanna sleep just drift away
mother kali, just tuck me in, take me in
take me out
heaven, hell and the underworld
give me the white, the red and black
it's all i ask, that's what i need
if you let me love and be true blue
i'll be more than just a dead man's hand on you
tell me lies won't be denied
mother kali, will you be my bride?
i'd paint your roses black and show you heaven
just to see your skin for one more second
it's all i want that's what i do
love me one more time and i'll let you kill me too
your eyes are full of hate, forty one,
that's good
hate keeps a man alive, its gives him strength
while cutting their shadows, kill them into the dark trough
black is all the way, furious neverending darkness show
only way could be hard in their small and human nation
i kill the first man, getting by death, we are god, through death
chorus
go, get up, victims that died
waiting for death, i should cry
take the farther off to cut your means,
listening up for afraid by means,
they showed laughing me for my heart
so they wake up these scythes, following me,
cold wind blow out, now to go,
let it go again with the scythes
something wild!
its got the light, blow it out within you
never let the best shot come from fucking avalon, thats the one
time to feel my spirit, i gathered my souls
beat my night to kill them into my sin doom, get up!
chorus
i cant wait to for my heart
i cant get up, shadows, down can't get up!
set them along, time is right, far too along
they wake me up wake me up!
i cannot get up by the howling cry
just justify my longing to die,
bury me down at last,
i think about it in the shadows and cry!
can scissors heal a man torn of tears,
a fading i fear inside.
the reaper in sheet will stand by me
i'm dreaming, i'm wearing a black dress that night!
i'm just a being tonight,
and still i'm dressed so black, oh yeah!
maybe i'm just blind,
but maybe i should try
can't you see why the vision is calling you?
i got the one, the dream of horror!
dreams of blood, dreams of war!
rudest eyes have seen the fright
welcome to the eternal night!
you won't be a butcher
no, you won't be at last
somebody's the trigger
take it off!
what, you are the priest's son? so fuck
so fuck yourself and die!
sill i stand against the death!
am i just a shade?
always i'm awake and in black!
sill i dare to praise the lord
no i won't pass to the lord
goodbye, no
so the keeper waits upon,
he waits upon a border
let me own your punishment,
it's time to break the border!
the candlelight fades away
there's nothing at all but me
i stare at death and the darkest one's
watching me with cold eyes
a god has been with me in the shadows
i lost my reason to hate! ya!
so it's right
i can leave the shadows!
the last one has to survive!
yaww!
wow, right!
with my light shining bright
i got my way, to regret? just my hearts
with my last dying rhyme i got my world
to betray for what i did by my motherfucking heart!
the shadows draw back into honesty and love!
obey, and it will cut your throat
i can't speak and you shan't be the next,
the shadows strike in your blame, yaw!
before the daylight falls to rest,
into shadows,
soon i'll be on a blacknight trip,
i'll fly across the sky.
it's not a lonely flight,
this one'll be black,
the death lies always in the sky,
it reflect hatred in my eyes.
if the daylight dies, the shadow's are falling on me.
then i'll be at your side,
always in the moonlight shadow,
i can't get out,
lost in time for eternity.
you're the guard of the dead ones,
in the night i'll find you to drink your blood,
you're the dead night's fresh meat in my arms,
the dead by night's close by!
don't wake it up, call my name, it's death!
set them all on a trip of pain,
i can't wait!
it's such a lonely flight,
this one'll be black,
the death lies always in the sky,
it reflect hatred in my eyes.
it is such a pain to allow,
being hard to wound
always in the moonlight shadow
i can't get out!
pulling the last cry, i was alive alive!
while i'm down in my hatred, weird, right right!
your god has set you on fire, this day the darkness light your way
when we, reach this final dusk
bring me fire and insanity
the jetblack eyes are showing butterflies,
they dance in the fire insane, so
chorus
fire dance with me
fire come with me
fire your fire
of the everlasting flame, did burn me
the one we are all off often struggling down, down, down, down
and when you hear me forth to the ever last,
hear me used to bear dreams cast in a silent near
fire, you're killing me
fire, a thorn, sweet, so rare
we'll praise the lord to begin it
until the others will fall
but, victims are we all
we will at last destroy human gods
and within us the fire is burning
the dream lives forth, we're standing strong to fight
and the everlasting fire is burning
chorus
a glance to my eyes, deep within reveals
this wornout warrior's mind
i'm killing you by suffering
discomposure of a deepest kind
in the night i crave to feel your breath
and your touch like angel of death
in the dawn i'm in chains of bestial rage
and forced to make you dead
the chains get tighter around my throat
i can give you no love, only deadlift of pain
in the dusk of evening i tuck you up with feather
forever i'll stand by your side
in the twilight of night i'm laughing
while cutting you hundred and thirteen times
can't you see i am evil, doubleedged razor
child of eternal hate.
to torment you like a motherfuckin' whore
i'll make you cry forever more
i'd crawl through broken glass to you
and your name is written in my very flesh
with the knife i'm still longing to use
in the night i crave to feel your breath
and your touch like angel of death
in the dawnism in chains of bestial rage
and forced to make you dead
i feel so lost for me inside,
lost am i, will it never end,
but never am i stained black
now the end is drawing near,
my hate is growing, can't you hear,
it burns me with my cruelty
and i'm off
like the fire of pain in the daylight
full of hate, your hatred gets up doom
chorus
hate, i can't control it anymore,
you'll see the red light more and more
trapping you in destroying despite
by the red light in my eyes
so, better wake up, drink your blood,
follow me and be a god
can't you fucking look into my eyes,
watch this god arise, yeah
come on!
i feel the last one in this time,
lost am i, will it never end
but never am i stained black, jet black
now walk away and flee into hell,
turn away and meet my eyes.
under my, bloodred scythe!
i can feel your hate of death,
i'm running on this darkened little path
take your time, beat me down, sometime, to die die!
chorus
doesn't matter what is on the top, right, way too down below,
that's how the werewolf burns in me
oh god, i see the light again,
i'm gonna be getting someone in my grave
chorus
get me some division,
i called the dead by night to the god!
allay the chaos!
chains to my last victim!
set up the lights on the way to the skies
raising my sword to the lord!
calling your death in a black obsession,
the only way wow!
right!
so wait for salvation
coming to me!
life to the saint,
life for me!
your lord,
who smashed this bloody god on earth,
is tonight by my side,
take me to the place to die for you,
and give me life in flames!
it's black after light,
an oddessey of the end,
a lord of chaos to be,
searching my dreams of the lives in my vision
it's a night of war, yeah!
the son of the night was,
left to destroy
i wait now to destroy...
say,
why this bloody god on earth,
is always by my side,
take me to the place where i die for you.
yaaaaawwww!
the last song of hate
is a song of my heart

instrumental
instrumental
i'm an outcast on the path of rebound
everything is frail, i desolate, crush, and burn
i have chosen darkness to be my guide
war is in my heart, death is by my side
chorus
war heart! with no remains of compassion or love
war heart! hate your fellow as yourself
i have chosen night to be my guide
when the daylight strikes, i hide in my trench and die
chorus
the night of timeless fire is drawing near
i flee, throughout the years of throe
watching through a mirror, as i fall apart
i see a wreck, i'm burning
i see angels burning, falling down in ruins
looking down i see me, i'm my own enemy
watching myself decaying, falling from high spirits
i flee, throughout the ruins of me
longing for finding my way out
leaving myself, there's nothing left for me
the ruins are about to crumble down.
the flame is dying by shivery winds of jet black skies
it reflects hatred in my eyes
i see angels burning, falling down in ruins
looking down i see my ashes scattered around my grave
angels whispering fire, no longer i'm alive
settled down i'm done with the trip to my kingdom come
right!
fire! the fire is more right than my eyes
don't remain, go misplay, you're so, so wild
traitor! your vengeance night, yes, always for me
always now, once you know, widow
right!
murder! your fire murders all my problems
ah oh yeah!
fire here i see the fire in my heart
traitor hate your face, obey or you're gonna die
murder murderer in you call me to die
oh yeah i'll come back to you when i'm dead
your voice is getting closer today fuck every day!
sleep up in the night  the lord doesn't matter in my fight
widow, tell me the reason
fire fire is into turning in my heart
traitor hate your face, obey or you're gonna die
murder: praying on my knee, i saw her near, come here
oh yeah i'll come back to you when i'm dead
i'm dead this is all, widow
in the silence of darkness, among the shadows of the dead we hear
and a wolf howling hungry to wake up children of the graves
unripe vengeance! the cult that serves as revenge
has put forward its fangs to declare a fucking war war
only calmless spirits of corpses are passing by
the altars of bodom where everything but death is a lie death is a lie
to spill your blood to become our wine
we'll reborn reality where only the wild will survive wild survived
kill!
the clash of wickedness veils lake bodom blood red
we have gathered our souls to praise the triumph of death
children of bodom, angry are rising
running amok slaying with a sense of desire
from the twilight of the past, among the victims who died
something wild has survived
only calmless spirits of corpses are passing by
the altars of bodom where everything but death is a lie
to spill your blood to become our wine
we'll reborn reality where only the wild will survive
this is something dark, i find your fears
we have gathered our dark souls to embrace the righteous pull of death
you'll obey the dark
you'll become one of us
taitors
children of bodom, angry are rising
running amok slaying with a sense of desire
from the twilight of the past, among the victims who died
something wild has survived
i see the candle light burning in your
eyes, flareing up my eyes in flames
on this pitchblack summer night
of passion and pain
the razor caressed my flesh
and my arms turned red, i feel a vast desire
years of pain are flowing down my arms.
sweet, red, warm stream you drink, make me released
give me your hand, let me make you feel the ease,
in the bed of razors we bleed together...
i feel the fire burning in my heart,
i see it sparkling in your eyes
the blaze you're feeding more and more
the razor caressed your flesh and your arms turned red.
i feel your vast desire
tearing pain is flowing down your arms.
sweet, red, warm stream i drink to make you released
holding your arms, cherish this composure,
in the bed of razors we sleep together, forever
no flickering light at the end of the path
confront repressions of the past
fear. prevail. insanity. obey!
draw back in silence to dwell in anxiety
no matter where i am, i'm alone
my dreams are shattered
into thousand running tears
the tears keep dripping down, down,
deep, down from my veins
i'm walking towards dead end i'm walking all alone
two steps behind insanity
there's no starlight guiding my way throughout this downward death row
soon will be the time i have to go
little by little the end is drawing near
another night and so little blood to spare
ya can hurt me, but ya can't possess me 'why know
kill me, hurt me, fuck me, rape me, you won't have me!
draw back in silence to dwell in anxiety,
no matter where i am, i'm alone. i'm crying out loud
the tears of blood i bleed, so fuck the world,
i'll go now, i don't care. who cares?
i'm walking towards dead end, and i'm walking all alone
two steps ago i past insanity
there's no starlight guiding my way out this downward death row
so now is the time i have to go
on the eve of their doom
they are baptized
in the unholy waters of bodom
with no hint of the torture awaiting
to greet them at the break of dawn
when the calm is setting in
we'll watch it swiftly disappear
too many years of silence
soon he's bound to reappear
the reaper
is calling for you to come home
with the thrust of a switchblade
on the grip of a madman
and the waters of bodom
turn a blood shade of red
as the children of bodom
take their last breath.
when the calm is setting in
we'll watch it swiftly disappear
too many years of silence
soon he's bound to reappear
once i desire, eternity has come
pull back, the tale is black, all we have to die
you say so, i am invading vision, satisfy
once i look back, so miracle
on a crib with the night
sensation, call me to die
look down, we have to sow and all waits to say go
once i desire, be back to hear this cry: let me out
and i am the first one, any want to die
chorus
with my salvation within your pain
you gotta develop pain into your desires
what it always about, you raise your pain
why you can't desire your cold regained?
come on, get down
i touch your legs, so cold, make me cold in the light,
and i burn now, no pain
your pain seems so far away,
so everything that's cold in light may die down
chorus
you raise your pain and i kill your strain,
anyway, i get into your desires my way
i crave your pain
i can't swallow your pain, why you returned
i found session, betrayed now, it's on now,
i saw, human, i see so
well i am certain of, i don't know how,
other souls beyond this smile
i hate you from the bottom of my heart
i have no fucking right now, i see so
beside you, i saw, ?,
other souls beyond this smile
well i thought now, i said i saw ?,
i saw it, your vanity, your mentality, ?
chorus
never seen the fooled beast inside of me,
well i'm an asshole, and i really will always be
so why now, oh let it be,
is that so fucking hard, oh be dead, i'm free
burn it hard, make a void that sucks to the suction drive
we need the open thing with my special little part of life
i tell you!
i'm accessing in all the northern light,
you know i got no fucking other souls, guilty now
i've got no fine, no fucking thoughts, so,
a combination, now you're fucking dead
chorus
go, conflict, terror, hear the noise
you're in the edge of a nerveracking force
oh my god, here's a fight
never siege, never riot, must defy
when you look at me, what do you see
another trophy like a fuckin' dead beat

are you dead yet
don't hear, don't deem. drown in before you dive
don't care, commit to your self destruction drive
i kiss the ground with love beyond forever
flip off the sky with bleeding fingers till i die
enemy, take a one good look at me
eradicate what you'll always be
your tainted flesh, polluted soul through a mirror i behold
throw a punch, shards bleed on the floor
tearing me apart but i don't care anymore
should i regret or ask myself
are you dead yet?
wake up, don't cry. regenerate to deny the truth
the fiction you live in blindfold your eyes
disclosure, self loathing. this time you've gone too far
or could it be, my nemesis that you are me?
hey there, i think i know you.
what was it, you're contending to do?
that's rite, manipulate everyone
around to deem you're over due
you try to slit your wrists
with a dry, blunt block of wood
upgrade it to a grater and still won't do no good
c'mon miss suicide, let me hand my blade
to you. and since we're here
you might as well cut me too.
like an acid flashback, it all came
back to me
slipped to drop a hit of you, one second later
i vomit i od'd, oh yes indeed
you try to slit your wrists
with a dry, blunt block of wood
upgrade it to a grater and still won't do no good
c'mon miss suicide, let me hand my blade
to you. and since we're here
you might as well kill me too.
miss suicide, let me get the door for you
let me love you black and blue
it's the least that i could do
miss suicide show me the way to the floor way down below
it's just a trifle hunch, that i'll beat you to the punch
i gotta say sometimes i just can't
deem all the things i've done
haunted to break the silence
out crying the truth that i want gone
and i'll run
back to the place where
i was told. drunken ignorance
is pure. true gold
feeling safe to rage, start acting mad
no regret. i'm content to be bad
relentless. no way i'm giving up.
i dare you make me stop
reckless  shattered dreams and broken ribs
annihilated into bits
forever, i'll stay on the run
you like to cling to my back like a monkey
not even a chance you'd let me go
fuck yeah i'm a madman. a jameson junkie
but i know u reap what u sow.
and it all just goes to show
hundred killers after you
what the hell you gonna do?
they think they're gonna kick your ass
bring u down make u crash
i neva thought the tables
would turn like this
that one day on your grave
i'm gonna spit and piss
c'mon you fucker lets go
by this time you already know
with that standpoint of bias
you can kiss my nordie pale white ass!
i'm a raw loose cannon til the end
to the depths of hell you
i will send
i'm a raw loose cannon
til the end
to the depths of hell
you i will send
i don't think anymore
eva liked me
and i don't give a fuck
would u really think i ever
dug you, hit me with a shovel
if i do
don't care have faith or mindset
plunder and pillage yet
complain whine and cry like a baby
ain't so tough after all
you claim that u don't believe in nothing
goddamn that must be exhausting
i know, you know this is getting
boring. a lil dull. don't you think
and not to mention hatred. loath and revulsion
you just throw around. like it's not
even there
embracing dissolution
is that who
i have become
over the years?
aversion to entity and
life in this world
broke you up in tears
when the night comes.
when the sunlight dies
that's what it sounds like
when a nihilist cries
so it finally all got
back to me
a real reactionary. is what
you'd like to be
when the night comes.
when the sunlight dies
that's what it sounds like
when a nihilist cries
let me get this one flat out straight
illuminate please it's not too late
since when did you become god?
you might be right. i've been tattered
'n torn. self destructing since i was born
so what's got to do with you?
close yet far  i've gone now
safe and sound  i don't know how
knuckled under  never giving up
and it all goes to show exactly what?
so much fun when you can tell me i'm dun
such a sweet unchaining sound
whisper me softly that i'm gonna die young
before you do take a look into the ground
it's not my funeral
if you rip my life apart in no time
i'll put it back together in 2.5
how's that for punctuality?
since you wanna fuck me over
and i know you do
better be aware i'm gonna fuck you too
but you should by now be schooled in that very piece of my minds's obscurity
just like the arctic circle
war in the snow unfolds
my death will carry on with you
i helped another madness
endure screaming shouts
wouldn't wanna wait for more
bow to the master of snow!
look at my kingdom
tequila shots kill me
to the winter of decadence
the preacher of violence
first punch sent you flying
look at my kingdom
why are you so slow
tequila shots kill me
a pitch in the fire
to a winter of decadence
that's how we roll!
i'll catch you dead in a sander
wish me luck for i'm going anymore
to slay for the fortune as before
on the floor next to a sawblade
this is my fist now beating you to blood
like i said, you won't hear anyone
this is the way we roll
at the fuckin northpole
we show no mercy
doing a god damn toll
look at my kingdom
tequila shots kill me
to the winter of decadence
the preacher of violence
first punch sent you flying
look at my kingdom
why are you so slow
tequila shots kill me
a pitch in the fire
to a winter of decadence
that's how we roll with a northpole throwdown
this is the way we roll
at the fuckin north pole
we show no mercy
this is the way we roll
at the fuckin north pole
we show no mercy
dead men all in the snow!
fuck!
when i close my eyes i keep falling
though i'm plunging down it's like flying
it's funny how i'm so high yet never floated
so low
just wanna revert from this horrid death row
and when i get back from numbness to feeling
thinking i was out, i got pulled back in
within this motherfucking
deadfall
confinement of terror
roundtrip
to hell and back
save me
forever lost i'm in
bounded
in a place that once was heaven
please don't let me go
hold me tight
all i am asking
is to make it alright
i've been dragged through
mud here
entirely beat up and torn
but when last night
comes back to me i sure as hell know
we rocked, went crazy
and far beyond
when i look back
and ask myself
was it worth it?
hell yeah
ignore the pain
hungover
but i'll do it again
crying
tears made of grit
flying
oh yea, it was worth it
withdrawal kickin' in. i can't shake it
yet in one way i have to take it
i'll rock. go nuts
and far beyond
and i look back
i don't need to know
was it worth it?
woke up to the sound of lucidity, feet on the ground
overwhelming delight wipes out the wreck of my
hollow mind
but when the dreams turn violent
repulsive mirror likeness, if you lay out my broken bones
beat up my heart with thirteen holes
would want to see the tragedy
of a mind that once belonged to me
take one good glance and you'll agree
like i said it's ugly, so goddamn ugly
after the terror you've seen
try to act like good human being
guess the ship i did steer, sank in the sea
of self loathing and fear
mine field is called the place i'm living in,
carefully watching each and every step i take.
bright white straight jacket chokes me off
my eyes are tired...
i... feel the cold steel on my forehead.
like... binding pleasure of being dead.
downward future! i descend...
counterblast!
and chokehold til' the end...
i'm flushed like the booze i hammer down,
like a piece of trash to be kicked all around.
when would be a time for a better day?
my cocked 'n' loaded soulmate leads the way
like i said, i'm ready to go
ease my pain desire
last night i begged to god
light my heart to fire
let me pour some taste down
see my last silent pain desire
let me take a last breath
before i saw, blind my eyes
triple corpse hammerblow
triple corpse hammerblow
don't push me...
don't push me...
don't push me!
let it trust my great vow
life goes away faster
let it trust the meaning
like life it was way before
move away the blow out
like it was by silent bodom
the way it feels, like it feel before
how you feel, feel before!
triple corpse hammerblow
don't push me...
don't push me...
don't push me!
billy idol cover
last night a little dancer came dancin' to my door
last night a little angel came pumping on the floor
she said, come on baby, i got a license for love
and if it expires, pray help from above
because
in the midnight hour she cried, more, more, more
with a rebel yell she cried, more, more, more
in the midnight hour, babe, more, more, more
with a rebel yell, more, more, more
more, more, more
she don't like slavery, she won't sit and beg
but, when i'm tired and lonely she sees me to bed
what set you free and brought you to me, babe
what sets you free, i need you hear by me
because
in the midnight hour she cried, more, more, more
with a rebel yell she cried, more, more, more
in the midnight hour, babe, more, more, more
with a rebel yell, more, more, more
he lives in his own heaven
collects it to go from the seven eleven
well he's out all night to collect a fare
just so long, just so long, it don't mess up his hair
i walked the ward with you, babe
a thousand miles with you
i dried your tears of pain, babe
a million times for you
i'd sell my soul for you, babe
for money to burn for you
i'd give you all, and have none, babe
justa, justa, justa, justa to have you here by me
because
in the midnight hour she cried, more, more, more
with a rebel yell she cried, more, more, more
in the midnight hour, babe, more, more, more
with a rebel yell she cried, more, more, more
more, more, more
oh yeah little baby
she want more
more, more, more, more, more
oh yeah little angel
she want more
more, more, more, more, more
come on!
hey! don't tell us what you want,
'cause we don't give a fuck about you and your kind.
you! you better take a step back where ever the fuck you came from.
no! you ain't one of us and to be tag along you're too ugly and blunt.
why?! is it so hard to get that we don't need you, stupid cunt!
if you don't know how to resent one another,
to gain the new way of power,
it'll get to the point where no one gives a fuck
what you may think of us or what you may not.
stop! are you ever gonna stop tryin' to be on the way that we wanna go?
fuck! it's pissing the fuck out of us when you don't understand the word
'no' !
now, you're tellin' that you'll win the war that's only battled 'cause you're
too dumb to die. that's right! you can take your war and shove it up your
ass, then close your eyes and say goodbye.
if you don't know how to resent one another,
to gain the new way of power,
it'll get to the point where no one gives a fuck
what you may think of us or what you may not.
we're hate crew, we stand and we won't fall...
we're all for none and none for all.
fuck you! we'll fight til' the last hit
and we sure as hell ain't taking no shit!
since day one ive been crass and far beyond.
i couldnt laugh, i couldnt cry.
before you judge me take a look at yourself.
condescending outlivin in a lie.
despite all the pain in my heart grinding through,
it aint due that you hate that i hate what you do.
despite all the piety youve been consuming thus far,
a backstabbing motherfucker to the bone is what you are.
chorus
and everyday when the knife in my back starts to twinge and turn,
my eyes are catching fire and my heart starts to burn.
a foot away from you is like a bit closer to heaven.
then again its like being needled 247.
you look down on me to see the scum of the earth to be.
fuck yeah thats me vile and obscene.
hey i aint happy about it but at least
i dont judge and decree to be better than another human being.
despite all the piety youve been consuming thus far.
can somebody please tell me what the fuck is going on.
fire of the light, lil' bloodred ridin' hood angel
you try reversing the ray of fire
light before the night, dark you'd try
the ray amid sets your desire
i'll kill you!
show me the signs of your silence
take me down, where i can feel you
in the race of corpse alone
my lil' bloodred ridin' hood
for a second did i go
c'mon motherfuckers!
little blood i'd blow away
it's a loss!
but i'll follow you 'till the end of the world
i hate you and i want you dead!
i'll kill it for you
i'll kill you!
show me the signs of your silence
in the race of corpse alone
take me down, where i can feel you
my lil' bloodred ridin' hood
i want no one to escape
i hear the footsteps going by
watching myself slowly die
sharp is the pain leading through my heart
slowly tearing me apart
one minute you're an angel fallen from grace
next, the fist that i hate
pick me up from the gutter with a gentle kiss
then rips off my heart to show me how black it is
no!
you're not good
it feels so cold
yet i won't turn back
i'll die alone
i hear the first sets walking by
watching myself slowly die
sharpening pain leading through my heart
slowly tearing me apart
when you appear as an angel
knocking me down, look in my way
could you ever kill the pain in my heart
even though they say: angels don't kill
no!
you're not good
it feels so cold
yet i won't turn back
i'll die alone
no!
you're not good
it feels so cold
yet i won't turn back
i'll die alone!
let's go
that's it, where to go?
should i tell you where i wanna go?
we'll die there be motherfucking there a broad away to be
you wilted away, i'll show you the place where i wanna die
we're gonna die in pain, don't hurt my eyes, i feel the flame,
sun's going down
sun's going down
moon's rising high
moon's rising high
we'll pay you the bodom beach terror
late night you party until it's light
while pointing at the sky
wash your hands in the lake of your blood
just before you die
bodom beach terror!
go go
to the place where you really wanna go
from the dark away to hit lights, to hit that human light
one minute shape to hit time where you gonna go
i bet you're gonna hit you to tear you down
to a place you've never seen
late night you party until it's light
while pointing at the sky
wash your hands in the lake of your blood
just before you die
bodom beach terror!
my pain is constant and sharp
and i do not hope for a better world for anyone
in fact,i want my pain to be inflicted on others.
somebody

stopping for my usual seat

solo
bloodshot eyes and a dead beat stance
shit for brains i'm a game of change
one cut, two cut counting scars
three cut horns up behind the bars
i'm not your patron saint
i'm not your patron saint
horns up or down and now horns up
i am your warpaint
you're not my angel dear
you're not my angel dear
lets make this crystal clear
horns up i am your worst fear
it's not the cough that carries me off
it's the motherfucking coffin they carry me off in
it's not the cough that carries you off
oh, it's the coffin they carry you off in
i'm not your patron saint
i'm not your patron saint
horns up or down and now horns up

i'm not your patron saint
i'm not your patron saint
horns up or down and now horns up
i am your warpaint
you're not my angel dear
you're not my angel dear
lets make this crystal clear
horns up i am your worst fear
you run but i'm always a step ahead
i'm a stalker you embrace while dread
i'm not your lover, you're not my only one
i'm not your child but you made me
your creation, your enemy
that one thing you'll regret forevermore
you can't destroy what i have become
too little too late, damage's done
from here on out it's torture
while i laugh, i laugh and you will cry
'cause and effect and then you die
there's more to pain than meets the eye
i'm deep inside you and you're mine
so take this to your mind
i am dominant
vile, too malevolent
the more you suffer i hurt
i'll get under your skin
when you scream i hurt
motherfucker i'm pain
i give you life then you take mine?
don't forget you were the partner in crime
i might be your slave but you're not my god
you're neither inside my head nor fiction
my malady, my affliction
the cross i carry on my knees until you laugh
and i will cry
'cause and effect and then you die
there's more to pain than meets the eye
i'm deep inside you and you're mine
so take this to your twisted little mind
i surrender
got no fight left in me to render
i wanna forget, do you remember?
i gave you a go
the light's now green, all you gotta do is kill me
but you keep me alive
to reap what you sew
just let me go
let me go
'cause and effect and then you die
there's more to pain than meets the eye
i'm deep inside you and you're mine
so take this to your mind
i am dominant
vile, too malevolent
the more you suffer i hurt
i'll get under your skin
when you scream i hurt
motherfucker i'm the end
i am dominant
vile, too malevolent
the more you suffer i hurt
i'll get under your skin
when you scream i hurt
motherfucker i'm pain
revvin' up your engine
listen to her howlin' roar
metal under tension
beggin' you to touch and go
highway to the danger zone
ride into the danger zone
headin' into twilight
spreadin' out her wings tonight
she got you jumpin' off the deck
and shovin' into overdrive
highway to the danger zone
i'll take you
right into the danger zone
they never say hello to you
until you get it on the red line overload
you'll never know what you can do
until you get it up as high as you can go
out along the edge
is always where i burn to be
the further on the edge
the hotter the intensity
highway to the danger zone
i'm gonna take you
right into the danger zone
highway to the danger zone
right into the danger zone
open your eyes, what have you done?
i've been back, forth stuck yet spun
too keyed to lie still, too tired to run
i can't believe it's come to this
it's safe to say that ignorance is bliss
bittersweet goodbye and one last kiss
forever is a long time that i won't miss
too tired to run it's getting late
make up your mind
i was never your kind
this is gonna hurt me black 'n' blue
but don't you think that no one measures up to you
i cant believe it's come to this
it's safe to say that ignorance is bliss
bittersweet goodbye and one last kiss
forever is a long time i won't miss
feel the hate we're breeding
fear the lives we're leading
cry while you watch me bleeding
the blood i have been spilling
love we keep on killing
was supposed to be for something
guess it was all for nothing
i cant believe it's come to this
it's safe to say ignorance is bliss
bittersweet goodbye and one last kiss
do you feel the hate we're breeding
fear the lives we're leading
cry while you watch me bleeding
cry while you watch me bleeding
we hear a prayer for the brighter morrow
it's hard to take thru all the laughter
we don't believe in tomorrow
it's just another morning after
i need you far away from me
i want you closer to me
i need you far away from me
i want you closer to me
we take a stand and we're standing tall
but only three of us crawl away
never get old nor would we fall
but only two of us saw yesterday
i never thought it would get this far, oh no
wherever you are, i won't follow
and when the candles slowly die
i will say my last goodbye
i need you far away from me
i want you closer to me
i need you far away from me
i want you closer to me
don't bother trying to save us
we don't need your prayers
because we were the afflicted
and none of us walked away
i need you far away from me
i want you closer to me
i need you far away from me
i want you closer to me
nightmares come as they go
recurring as they show
the movie i've seen
way too many times
don't ask me how it all ends
just count your stars and pray
that there wont be
a part for you to play
let me break it down
while you're racking up your brain
it's a constant downpour
and never only rain
push me for more mileage
or drive me fuckin' insane
it don't matter to me
just pick a lane
you've been on this trip before
how long until you learn
i'm a suicide bomber
born to crush and burn
flying on a suicide bomber
let me break it down
while you're racking up your brain
its a constant downpour
and never only rain
flying on a suicide bomber
we're gonna crash
we're gonna crash
we're gonna burn
we're gonna burn
flying on a suicide bomber
we're gonna crash
we're gonna crash
we're gonna burn
we're gonna burn
holding the key to my darkened past
she's spinning with voices lost in past
the memory too disturbed
she's a story that'll never end
you're a two studded chain, a tear in my soul
she'll fly away with me when all said and done
but now she's gone
i don't believe in faith
the art of finding love
refuse to let this cut me deep
now to make her pay
left to feel so numb
yes, you may cut me again
but i mark these words with a blade
that i'll find you once again, morrigan!
she's the coming of my demise
in every way, seen her alluring disguise
a sixfoot tall bloody, jetblack scythe
is all that's with me with the things i've done
because she's gone
i don't believe in faith
the art of finding love
refuse to let this cut me deep
now to make her pay
left to feel so numb
yes, you may cut me again
but i mark these words with a blade
that i'll find you once again, morrigan!
i ain't gonna leave from the post, so stay
on the way, get away from the twilight's scream
i refuse to let this cut me deep
i refuse to let this cut me deep!
i don't believe in faith
the art of finding love
refuse to let this cut me deep
now to make her pay
left to feel so numb
yes, you may cut me again
but i mark these words with a blade
that i'll find you once again, morrigan!
no peace of mind from quietude
haunting nightmares follow thru
the panic that lingers in my eye
'til i rip shit up, make angels cry
contort the silence sighing faintly
my dark twisted secrets gravely
every night's the same the world is sleeping
yet my demons keep come creepin'
thru the cracks of my shattered mind
so i stir up the chaos one more time
mayhem, wrath i call thee mine
and both the sun and moon will shine
end of times, just kill the quietude
hear my cries, and start the countdown
bury my crimes, somewhere deep within
it's not that complicated
simply i just worship chaos
turmoil, terror i now conjure
the hell in my head please do conquer
so i throw down kickin' and screaming
lie flat on the ground discarded and bleeding
but the noise is gone that's why
i stir up the chaos one more time
how'd i wake up in a ditch
oh son of a bitch this time i'm not gonna make it
last night lingers in the air
i've been everywhere and i can't i just can't shake it
pick up the broken bones anything goes
i just wanna run the fuck away as fast as i can
further than the middle of nowhere anywhere
too shot too run, what the hell have i done, there's blood everywhere
i see it, fell it, don't want to believe it
i've crossed the line, way past the line
i'm addicted, dejected over the edge my soul's infected
you were my first, bottom of the stack
i'm done with the past, i'm reborn so watch your back
run away, crawl away, come come closer
avert your eyes, it's almost over
beg and plead say please put your head down
cover your face like it's gonna fucking help are you ready
are you ready, are you ready?
i am the only one you left me walk away dismay
slowly turns exerted not gonna be deserted
i am the only one you left me unscathed
keep your eyes averted
you were my only one but now you're just another victim deserted
run away, crawl away, come come closer
avert your eyes, it's almost over
are you ready?
are you ready?
i am the only one you left me walk away dismay
slowly turns exerted not gonna be deserted
i am the only one you left me unscathed
keep your eyes averted
you were my only one but now you're just another victim deserted
i am the only one
i am the only onenot gonna be deserted
i am the only one
keep your eyes averted
the path i walked is now
covered in dust of contrition
as you say i've lost my way
the nights getting clouded over
i hear the echo of your call
sweet words softly weaving
my eyes are open and bleeding
one way or another
has never been the right direction
our sky or another
could be on reflection
i'm looking up if the stars sign
the afterlife that is to be mine
and wonder if you let them shine
alive or dead, but not dead yet
widdershins and hence we fly
the left hand path
attract a wicked mind
backwards we walk thru
the maze of life we spent
a new beginning could be the end
i'm lookin' up and the stars sign
our afterlife that you are to be mine
don't wonder just let them shine
widdershins and hence we fly
the left hand path
attract a wicked mind
alive or dead, but not dead yet
you dance around me
widdershins and the two tormented souls met
sick to death, filled to the brim
of feigning interest in your life
be it a god, be it a knife
an answer to the never ending strife
to hold your tongue speaks of truthful pain
its not like i haven't already heard you complain
breathe it in or out, puke, swallow or spit
silence ain't golden when gold has turned to shit
but enough's enough
don't tell me once again
life is constant pain
i've lost what i'll never find
tripped down when i was blind
but at least i know
when to drain the bitter cup
and when its time to simply just
shut the fuck up
go ahead, cut it up or cut this back
i only hope you understand indifference
that i just don't give a damn
to hold your tongue speaks of truthful pain
its not like i haven't already heard you complain
breathe it in or out, puke, swallow or spit
silence ain't golden when gold has turned to shit
but enough's enough
don't tell me once again
life is constant pain
i've lost what i'll never find
tripped down when i was blind
but at least i know
when to drain the bitter cup
and when its time to simply just
shut the fuck up
don't tell me once again
life is constant pain
i've lost what i'll never find
tripped down when i was blind
but at least i know
when to drain the bitter cup
and what the fuck?
don't tell me once again
life is constant pain
i've lost what i'll never find
tripped down when i was blind
but at least i know
when to drain the bitter cup
and when its time to simply just
shut the fuck up
this is how the lucky feel
how the blessed men think
like a daybreak in spring
the sun on spring morning
like the flat brink of a cloud
like the dark night in autumn
but how do i feel
in my gloomy depths?
this is how the lucky feel
how the blessed men think
like a daybreak in spring
like the flat brink of a cloud
like a dark night in autumn
a black winter day
this is how the lucky feel
how the blessed men think
like a daybreak in spring
the sun on spring morning
like the flat brink of a cloud
like a dark night in autumn
a black winter day
not darker than that
gloomier than an autumn night
a black winter day
running under cover of the moonlight
shadow death row. at the night we're
running wild with no hope for tomorrow
no tomorrow
as we're walking through the fire,
that burns within us all. if ya want to take
a glance to the blaze of pain, you'll never
be the same.
you want to get closer and get a taste
of death? i know ya want to fuck me down
til' i'm bleeding red. i couldn't care less,
i'll end up rotting in mud, so c'mon mothafucka
and gimme yer best shot.
you really thought you'd see through what
i am and what i need, we are children of
rebellion, we'll fight, we'll bleed.
don't try to come to preach over us and
over me, we're children of decadence, we're
right, we're real, we will fight, we'll bleed,
we're mothafucking dying breed, we're dying...
loosing the war i'm feining to win
though i never tried to to strive deep
from within. life could be beautiful
for anybody it's for, but i'd swear this
mothafuckin' shit is rotten to the core.
the portal has been past and it's
time to make a turn, to follow the reaper
until the point of no return.
when your blindly deathraying blade
sweeps the griefs and fears away.
i cross my heart and hope to die thy freedom
will be mine.
sinking down in the ocean of severe emotions.
grab a bottle to drink up the painreliefing potion.
but after all, that got boring too, so no matter
what happens, i couldn't give a damn or too.
the portal has been past 'til the
point of no return. no more lines to cross,
no bridges to burn.
now when your blindly deathraying blade
swept my griefs and tears away. i'd never go back
to cross that line.
i cross my heart and hope to die.
i was born in ashes of molten hatred
raised by demons in abodes of the end
the reaper's scythe i fall upon to light my path
wrecked by mangled wounds of life
i have become become the resurrection of the evil one
'yknow that i don't fucking care if i live or die
i need a bishop preaching fire to get away with my sins
i despise everything i see so i don't give a fuck if ya hate me
ain't got respect for humanity
never lived or wanted immortality
the reaper's shadow i fall upon to obscure my path
every day i'm being battered up until i bleed
you motherfuckas just leave me be
ya could never give me cure for the pain i feel inside
led by the reaper i walk in the night
show me the way to yer kingdom come
hellhound, hot leather on your legs
that smokin powder keg
you're riding on is hellbound
and you're the one they claim
it's going down in flames
you're riding hades' rails hellion
hellion
the devil's hellion child
hellion
will never have to die
well child, you're sweatin' and you're stoned
that alcohol you downed
makes you crazy
all night, you damn the hurt and pain
and drink the devils rain
it's screaming out your name
the gods you worship are steel
at the altar of rock 'n' roll you kneel
a slave who forever rocks
is chained in the devil's locks
and slain by the bloody axe i wail
yeah ho
yeah ho
the faint blaze of the candle of my life
slowly dying like a fire in a pouring rain
no sparks of hope inside
no shooting stars on my sky
on broken wings, no flying high
another night, another demise
cadaverous wind blowing cold as ice
you'll let the wind blow out the light
'cause it gets more painful everytime i die
out of strength to fight
i cannot take another night
i cannot take it no more
lust of light slips through my fingers
like blood on my arms
black candle wax has buried me
ang on got to go
preview what they ought a know
keep your head down and fucking die
wake up rise and shine
gotta take another pint
dig heads and watch out for the night
when the sun comes down and the moon comes up in the sky
the battle of the day and the night
kill, kill, kill go fuck another one
candlelight burns in a wood so high
on a carpet flying high take it down to the other side
the way beyond it may lie
when the moon comes up and is rescuing under the night
the reaper is on the other side, let's go
bodom after midnight
bodom after midnight yeah
eight above yer shadow smiles at me
way down below i hear your serenely breathe
i'm running after you throughout
the valleys of tormented souls
don't you be afraid of me only kissing your shadows
you're so far away, i can your scent
when i carries your shadow
and if you truly want i'll cross the line i'll follow
i'm dreaming my way out from down below
to get wherever you haunting from, i'll go
i'm kissing the shadows you surround me with
to feel my pain vanishing away from me
your touching the shadows i'm surrounding you with
so together in pease we shall be
i'm running after you throughout
the valleys of tormented souls
don't you be afraid of me only kissing your shadows
you're so far away, i can your scent
when i carries your shadow
and if you truly want i'll cross the line i'll follow
i can't waste away, i'm slowly losing my way forever
better raise your slave for me anymore
daylight's sin inside, day's growing closer, wait for pain
i cannot wait another night to be alone
voices are calling me, 'be my night!' this devil's sigh
yeah, shadows are tainting me, yeah,
i know that only you can render pain
peace of mind, you run away from me
so make me lose my mask of sanity
i can't waste away, i'm slowly getting my way forever
better is what i used to feel alone
shattered light's sin in taint, day's growing longer, wait for pain
i cannot wait another night to be with you
peace of mind, you run away from me
so make me lose my mask of sanity
peace of mind, you run away from me
so make me lose my mask of sanity
you're the one who plays with fire in the night,
you're the one who scares people with the scythe
you're the one to tell him to ever live by,
you're the lord to shaking all alone
you're alone!
now you left me out to drop his sight:
i wasn't ready for the sunlight to come to my heart
take me with you, take me far take me away from the painless soul
drop the haze save the skies, reaper never lies
now running out to forever alone,
sweating and shivering cold right to the bone
pain is come control to fall
become for the mad to escape with a bottle from this world
you're far too alive: try back to the sky
i wasn't ready for the scythe get me down to the trough
like lightning from the sky,
the moon is up with pride go listen, take away
your place for my lying out being high, come heaven above
drop it now: it falls alive take me to the sky
rip and cut and mutilate the innocent,
his friends, and again and again and on and on.
you make me own my life in hell, my kingdom back to the bound
you say you don't make it alone, kingdom back to the lord
falling, i say, you too, falling, you too, born to die
come with hate
come and die
one day i'll face you all alone,
enduring out with wind and ice
it's payback time, it's your demise sought to feel:
they'll taste of my scythe
you say my ear, my god who help me, god take yours in shame
back too low, i want your head on a plate to feel my eyes
come with me, i want your blood to save it on my eyes
i want you and in the plate to be coming in the sky sky!
come with hate
come and try
one day i'll face you all alone,
enduring out with wind and ice
it's payback time, it's your demise until they feel:
taste of my scythe

i was born in ashes of molten hatred
raised by demons in abodes of the end
the reaper's scythe i fall upon to light my path
wrecked by mangled wounds of life

i believe in armageddon, i've been baptized in alcohol

i'm living for my own demise
spoken intro:
they say drinking is a way to die, but at the end
dying is a way to drink, that's why...
i'll break or dance, let you decide.
too much of foreign you bring on by.
do you have something to blame in such short time?
you are the one crying.
degenerate, throwing the wreck of life.
someone is spilling your own blood.
that's very hot, scars already made.
ready for another drink anyone?
they talk to you but no we don't.
we thought maybe you gone too far.
day over day, they should get it hard
yes we die, they could never stop.
blooddrunk
wasted again.
they smile or they will fight.
blooddrunk
you call me insane.
you get me blooddrunk with a razor blade.

it's a color that i can not show
when i could easier pose
but you probably knew that i was lost
did you think that i would right now
show you things i have lost?
swim if you're diving for a human being
yaow!
i blame myself for every second
that i was gripped by some foe
standing for the only one, for you
to kill me by your left toe
what even can i say, get me out
i was the one who sold
my body and soul to the devil
no one that i know when i say
"i am the one" would lie
since when we spoke i stream with fire
wake up in a pool of blood
locked up, when you get banned from heaven
looking i just saw me dripping down blood
don't worry, i'll get up to get down where i belong
banned from, heaven
banned from, heaven
banned from, heaven
banned from, heaven
wake up in a pool of blood
locked up, when you get banned from heaven
looking i just saw me dripping down blood
don't worry, i'll get up to get down where i belong
wake up in a pool of blood
locked up, when you get banned from heaven
looking i just saw me dripping down blood
don't worry, i'll get up to get down where i belong
after the war
i was for ten of those years of yore
lost in the sea
by a harsh god's agency
but through the years
love urged my will to be solid and clear
and for my wife
i risked the loss of my life
bridge i
for her
i did not eat lotus from its twig
for her
the sorceress could not change me into pig
for her
i blinded the cyclops' single eye
the cannibals did not make me die
all for her
chorus
for her
i worked my way
for her
i moved away
from my destiny
shipping across the sea
for her
i could resist
in my frail heart, the fortune's twist
and i was the last
true hero from the past
sailor, come here...
i hear a trace of the ocean noise
fascinated...!
the move of waves is like a voice
hero come near
i can hold on with a tight rope
captivated...!
i've got a hope
chorus
faustus
the time has come for you
and here's your sentence
that is your fate and
it's no use repentance
you must pay with your soul, faustus
you have come to your goal, faustus
you wished the deepest
knowledge of tomorrow
and power to clean off
grievance and sorrow
we have made your wish true, faustus
now we are over you
love, your force may get me free
and show me how to flee
from my fate
when my time is over
love, you help me to understand
that all is in my hand
just today
not far away
bridge
love..., i've fallen in distress and dismay
because i'm waited
predestinated
fated...!
chorus
mephisto, the intriguer
for your soul, is eager
there's a compact you've consented
with blood your soul have been rended
chorus i
her soul will be a swan
until
she feels
the love of nobleman
forever her soul will be a swan
until
she feels
the love of noble...
in swan lake
in swan lake
in swan lake
in swan lake
tired to ride in the royal hunt
to listen sweet lies that i am wont
i am the prince!
the future king!
boomed in my head my mother's voice
take to wife! should be my choice
oh, cruel fate!
that my soul hate!
to forget all i fled into the woods
searching preys goods
then i saw the lake
lost in the deep forest
and its water chorused
an odd melody
swans of nice white feather on the dusk
swam in a dance in harmonious masque
hunter i am!
my bow was prepared
bridge
but her beauty was shown me in the depth
spouting, silent, from the lake
and her pale look kept a sad poem
lost in despair
dragged into the warlock's lair
in the shadows
chorus i
her soul will be a swan
until
she feels
the love of nobleman
forever her soul will be a swan
until
she feels
the love of noble...
like a night tide
together we cried
our lips sealed its secrets way
and my doubts died
but when came the dawn
my dream sank covered by dark waters
bridge
but her beauty was shown me in the depth
spouting, silent, from the lake
and her pale look kept a sad poem
lost in despair
dragged into the warlock's lair
in the shadows
chorus i
her soul will be a swan
until
she feels
the love of nobleman
forever her soul will be a swan
until
she feels
the love of nobleman
chorus ii
my princess's tears fall in the moonglade
the lake is afraid
the night shows the spell
then i can feel my heart run into my chest
now i know my quest
in the hell of the storm
i'll break her swanform
so inside the waves
we will find our graves
but the warlock's curse will be broken
bridge
but her beauty was shown me in the depth
spouting, silent, from the lake
and her pale look kept a sad poem
lost in despair
dragged into the warlock's lair
in the shadows
chorus i
her soul will be a swan
until
she feels
the love of nobleman
forever her soul will be a swan

chorus ii
my princess's tears fall in the moonglade

so inside the waves
we will find our graves
but the warlock's curse will be broken
the rothboart's curse will be broken
the rothboart's curse broken...
the rothboart's curse broken...
the rothboart's curse broken...
the rothboart's curse broken...
chorus iii
our spirits will be free
will fly
the sky
over the green lake's trees
forever our spirits will be free
will fly
the sky
over the green lake's trees
remember us in the stars
remember us in the stars
it's a long hard way
to find a solution
so i feel so stray
day by day
and when moon's full
i'm the evil evil's tool
causing a dastardly havoc
i can't retaliate
but when i'm a man again
i've got just a rest of pain
when i turn into my shape just
a sense of guilt remains
i feel ferocious
oh ooh oh, howling for the mayhem i've just made
i feel atrocious
oh ooh oh, howling at the moon before it fades
yes, it's a malady
i can not suffer at all
seek a remedy
and just fall
and when moon's full
i'm the evil's tool
inside me a harsh beast wailing
i hardly hold in
but when sun appears i'm sane
i'm released from my cruel bane
and i'm able to endeavor
to clean up my soul stain
voy a hablar por boca de mi gente
expresando su deseperacin
quiero cuentas de nuestra educacin
alguno de ustedes destruy nuestra ilusin?
he vivido la tristeza de mi generacin
cuentos de ayer y de hoy
siempre aprendiendo la misma leccin
fue nuestra cultura quien nos hizo traicin
hemos inventado la comunicacin
hemos desechado la prostitucin
no nos interesan los imperios
y hemos practicado el amor
vamos a parar la burda evolucin
el regreso a los bosques es la solucin
no queremos mquinas de competicin
tenemos el caballo, no existe el reloj
queremos ver limpia la tierra
no la tapeis con alquitrn y hormign
fuera guerra intiles
guardad vuestras armas para otra ocasin
queremos vivir en praderas
y ver la puesta de sol
hacer nuestra casa en un rbol
plantar muchas flores con nuestra cancin
fuera guerras intiles
guardad vuestras armas para otra ocasin
only with you i want to stay
flying across the space away
i am feeling like a real king
and beneath us is everything
i haven't treasures nor estates
but i offer something great
over the tops of oldest trees
your flying soul plays with me
the wind is a stroke when the air is clean
such a view i've never seen
pleasure of freedom, i can fly
further, further, high so high
chorus
fast my magic, fast
flying across the skyline
my free heart at last
forever will be mine
close to you, alone with me
crossing skies or sailing seas
for my magic is fancymade
but my illusions never fade
pleasure of reedom, i can fly
further, further, high so high
chorus
instrumental
dark thoughts invade my mind
the dancing is frenzy
the monolith raises sinister
a monotonous melody
the madness is a torturing game
slow is killing me
my soul cries bitter hopes
while they all sing
chorus
the call of cthulhu
the call of cthulhu
crazy dreams...
remember the words of necronomicon
the wind howls again
the black gate opnes silently
do i see the truth?
hideous tentacles on his face
a shout without voice
immense mountains of malevolence
while they all pray
chorus
"that is not dead
which can eternal lie
yet with strange aeons
even death may die"
remember the face of my master
in my dreams under the sea
open the door and rip the veil
tell me the word, give me the power
of the black ancient knowledge
ia jag sathot
ia sub ne gu rath
chorus
tells the legend, there's a magic place
that could nobody find its trace
land of darkness, land of forlorn songs
where all is mystic all along
the traveller
where i am? lost in the stream
is it real or a dream?
my stunned mind listens to a call
like a spirit into crystal ball
but in depth, i see a gleam
fearful i'll follow the beam
with the shadows i will brawl
so i will arrive to the light hall
dark moor, dark moor
welcome to the dark moor
dark moor, dark moor
welcome to the hall
spirit of the art
who comes in the hall of olden dreams?
the traveller
i listen to a voice in my head
spirit of the art
speak! and then i just could deem
the traveller
i don't know why i am here
spirit of the art
i read in your fate
choir
choose your goodness! choose your badness!
spirit of the art
you must cross the gate!
devil of greed
it is too late
the traveller
yes! i obey the command
find the gate in shadowland
if my destiny it wrote
only the trust wants it to denore
dark moor, dark moor
welcome to the dark moor
city of the dreams, where is its gateway?
dark moor, dark moor
welcome to the dark moor
among gothic gargoyles always the art stays
dark moor, dark moor
welcome to the dark moor
sleeping in the darkness there's a light
dark moor, dark moor
welcome to the dark moor
bathing like moon in the silent night
choir
care with the nice evil lies
because the greed never dies
care with the sweet false promise
which proclaims the paradise
spirit of the art
don't listen to it's false word
moreover don't fight with it's bejewelled sword
and ever don't play in its black rich board
remember
the traveller
who's there in the dark?
devil of greed
i'm who keeps the ark
the traveller
why do you talk me?
devil of greed
your friend i could be
the traveller
why'll i trust in you?
devil of greed
it would be a good view
the traveller
move away! with your false hopes
devil of greed
your illusions are your slope
the traveller
you don't try to cross my way
devil of greed
riches you can not slay
the traveller
perhaps i cannot win
nor a new world begin
but now and ever in my heart the art will be my sin
dark moor, dark moor
welcome to the dark moor
sleeping in the darkness there's a light
dark moor, dark moor
welcome to the dark moor
bathing like moon in the silent night
the traveller
i can see
in my soul
the gate's before me
mystery's real
my destiny
devil of greed
you won't free
the traveller
let me go
devil of greed
you can't flee!
the traveller
no!
i am falling slow
the traveller
then i crossed the gates of oblivion
in the dark moor my spirit could fly
i am glad about my decision
as my word could always testify
with the muses i danced in the night
beneath the full moon i felt the spell
and its poetry gave me its fine old bite
and i could never say farewell
and the music in my heart
filled my illusions with the art
and the angels showed me
which is the way of the stars
choir
like a dream immortal
you crossed the dark portal
you will be blasphemer, deemer, dreamer
this is the gift of the gods
which for men will be odd
this is the dream of the demons who envy it
the traveller
oh! in the end of time
muses teach me that i'm
who choose my truth forever
oh! spirit of the art
if my soul must depart
my mind will stay with you
spirit of the art
poet of the dark glance
in your eyes a romance
with it i dance
musician of the dreams
the traveller
my inspiration will be
all the strength of my destiny
i wake up and my throat screams
was it real or a dream
but why's tears there in my eyes?
masquerade, masquerade
grab your mask and don't be late
get out, get out
well disguised heat and fever in the air tonight
meet the others at the store,
knock on other people's door
trick or treat they have the choice,
little ghosts are makin' lotsa noise
but watch out
beware

take care
in the streets on halloween there's something going on
no way to escape the power unknown
in the streets on halloween the spirits will arise
make your choice it's hell or paradise
ah, it's halloween
ah, it's halloween tonight!
someone's sittin in a field,
never giving yield
sitting there with gleaming eyes,
waiting for a big pumpkin to arise
bad luck if you get a stone,
like the good old charlie brown
you think linus could be right
the kids will say it's just a stupid lie
but watch out
beware
listen
take care
in the streets on halloween there's something going on
no way to escape the power unknown
in the streets on halloween the spirits will arise
make your choice it's hell or paradise

we are calling you
and there's magic in the air
magic in the air on halloween
black is the night full of fright
you'll be missing the day
what will be here very soon
changing your way
a knock on your door
is it real or is it a dream
on trembling legs you open the door
and you scream on halloween
darkness
where am i now
is there anybody out there
what has happened
am i in heaven
or is it hell
i can see a light comin'
it's comin' nearer
it's shining
it's shining so bright
it's shining on me
i am the one
doom's in my hands
now make your choice
redeemed or enslaved
"i'll show you passion and glory"
he is the snake
"i'll give you power and abundance"
he's the corrupter of man

i will fight for all mankind
deliverance and peace of mind

no way to escape the power unknown
in the streets on halloween the spirits will arise
make your choice it's hell or paradise
yeah, it's halloween
yeah, it's halloween tonight!
open my eyes felling the dark
with downward eye, gaze sad
under the rain walking alone
looking for the last door
i hear a song and touch the stars
from dawn to dusk
there is a force of clatiry
there is a light
gaze not in my eyes!
can i enter the hole of light?
you reach a hand to hold me but
i can't be your awake gide
breath's a ware that will not keep
i must keep my last breath
like the mass of the hills
when the moonlight revive
shinning on the blind eyes
i'm feeling that
time remains what is was
i am waiting for you
at the end of a tune
in the dawn, in the grey dawn
time leave me now
legends always say
the dark one makes his play
with uncautious men
lie in his name
from inner egypt came
don't fear his word
don't go to his den
the strange dark one to whom the fellahs bowed
silent and lean cryptically proud
worming into your mind
driver you mad
like the snake which can find
what is bad
biting with sharp teeth
your frail reason
scratching in your mind beneath
frantic crowds are under his commands
wild beasts follow him and lick his hands
the shadow of the nile
who gnaws your soul
the bright of black smile
that your mind stole
the shadow of the nile
in desert storms
the old one who beguiles
takes diverse forms
through the mindless void
he leads you
claws he had deployed
he bleeds you
"the messenger i am
know the fate:
there is not peace in the gate"
this is the story of more than a man
a notable gentleman born in bergerac
who his life gave for impossible goals
that both time and fortune stole
in a soulless world
where all is such cold as false
where all has been whirled
as if was a mad waltz
i mean to be like
the warm spirit of a song
noble and dreamlike
now and for so long
in the battle and the poetry
brave and dashing i will be
and when foes came ten to one
was a foul game and i won
while i made rhymes with the wit sword
and when love came light which glows
was my sad shame: heart or nose
nose she chose
falls the curtain
making certain
i'm not shadow of my friend
but the glory
wrote my story
true love i'll defend
to the end
but the drama had
words behind good appearance
his beauty was clad
with my spirit and romance
but the beauty died
and soon the voice was got mute
letters dulcified
turn into spoilt fruit
in my dreams and false illusions
sweetest lover i will be
and when love came light which glows
was my sad shame: heart or nose
nose she chose
i'm dying
death can't catch
a sole thing, my penache!
now i see
what my soul didn't
ideal true love, real would be
if my eyes has been my heart
my eyes show pain now i know he's free
and he'll never be close to me
hero who romantically died
poet who made people sadly cry
your mind, can't find, can't find
a strong bind, a sure bind
lover who can love with no reward
gentleman whom will sing all the bards
your mind, can find, can find
a solid sign for world is not so blind
when the golden dusk covers me
and the beams play with the trees
memories so come to my heart
because the guardian of the dreams departs
bridge:
who stole my illusions?
who stole my hopes?
why did the light off
unseen i grope?
where will i find the force
'to untie the past's rope' not coherrant enough
in my soul?
chorus:
go on
within the black night of the age
getting my sadness turn to rage
even oblivion
so feeling will be free again
the dreams will break the chains
flying to the eternity
sometimes in dreams i see her eyes
watching me like wells of lies
those in the cold cloak of the night
were my sole flame , of whom i was acolyze
bridge
chorus
where are the guardians of their dreams, return to me
tell me the answers that my mind will live again
chorus
nobody can be back
from that forgotten land
the furthest one, the blac
lonely and gloomy sand
the bridge's narrow and thin
the sentry waits patiently
people to pass it
in despair but valiantly
no one reduced his pace
no one looked back with grief
no one changed his face
no one felt relieved
you sense their noisy treads
and look the stone face
and they seem the dead
of a forgotten race
last land, last land
with the sword in my hand
just a word i can hardly say
while our foe we slay, walhalla
mighty odin just states
no surrender but defeat
real warriors learn too late
that die is like to beat
glory in war is always better
than honor, love and wealth
written in golden letters
present and future destroyed by strength
all of them have been killed
without dropping their blade
ranks of gods have been filled
to make war when giants invades
valkyries have chooses their sore
warriors doomed the fall
leading them into war
in the days of armageddon
i know that you need me
to survive in this world
world of empty words
take my hand and feel me
if i'll be your friend...
forever be
bridge:
in the dephts of wind
could be playing with me
your symphony
playing on and on
never be alone
sing my song
i stay by your side, girl,
through the endless hate, my dear,
the rain dissapears
the poison of your life
fills my glass and i...
i drink, i die
bridge
in the wood while elves their instruments play
sing about a place far away
on the black hill when the dwarfs carve the stone
tell about the wizard's home
beyond the white hills
plying the gold sea
you'll see the way begins
if you want to see the sign
you must use your mind
and follow the wind
chorus
run to the magic land
where all has begun
run to the magic land
magic is waiting for you
the acolytes direct their steps just there
but they must always beware
because only the best one can survive
where others will lose their life
it can be unreal, or it can be real
search in your mind
f you follow the clue
you'll know that it's true
and the doors will shine
chorus
mater of wizards aid me to understand
the secrets of the moon and the sun
teach me the strength and the essence of the spell
powers of heaven and hel
if you place your hand
over the markede sand
we'll begin the rite
earth, water and fire
and air we desire
magic will be right

fort terrois imparata
terra mortes est sembrata
demonorum generatjo
romanorum contestatio
from east came storms leading fire and iron
by grim demons gathered all as worms
track the trails and find the place to environ
breaking through winds on their way to rome
to the city, source of evil vices
everybody calling it their home
in the time when it grows and rises
a rush is coming provoking its fall
in the air
everywhere
in despair
gust that blows out
in the breeze
the disease
breaking out
flying about
riding horses
they have blood thirst
firing grasses
on their way
blaming crosses
they slay, they burst
in black masses
they are the god's enemies
they are the god's enemies
they are satan's breed
while their preys run
they dash over frays and nuns
attila the hun
barbarian trail of blazes following the sun
attila the hun
is bad seed, and devil cruel son
the bad deed is done
for all people is fleeing and can hold on no one
rome is just over

honores!
the dust just covers

who in the night
with wet sight
doesn't think that it's rougher
his hard life
i mean strife
load that we suffer?
life
divine blow
life
more than we know
i feel immersed
in the clockwork of the universe
deep metaphor
in which i'm the very core
but i realize
with sunrise
that are shades all my sorrows
in this wheel
i can feel
there're much tomorrows
life
it's what we're
life
valley of tears
like a gift
one descends when you're lift
it's like a whim of the eternity
it's a kiss
within your bliss
has every color you see
a unique love rose from a unique hate
two lovers were caught by their appalling fate
the enmity of their families made
the passion fade and the pain unquell
when dawn came, the city was covered by
a mantle of tragic sighs
the walls of the towers are hard to climb
they're a place of death if you mention who you are
a thin ice covers my soul
my body is frozen and cold
the skies from blue turn to grey
all my desire carries no shame
i'll spread my wings to hold you in my arms
like daylight chasing the dark
no one can hear me, it's the sound of the night
tears in my hands. only loneliness i'll find
from the grave i watch in the shadows
since those years, the age of deep pain
when i hear the drums of battle
beats my heart, greedy for revenge
wait my queen, my wife of the dark death
i'm the damned one, you sucked all my blood
in your fangs my youth was delighted
all hope is revenge, blood for good
chorus
fight, oh! knights
recover the kingdom
army of spectres
prepare my return
oh! my lords
dark is the wisdom
that makes grow my flesh
with the songs of the swords
night has come, remember old spells
i move my hands, my lungs can now breath
here i say, hence i must be free
all is true, my body still creeps
shake your hair, my sweet beast of hell
tint your claws, i will kiss you soon
you can't hide, your smell i sure know well
cry loudly now, for it's your last moon
chorus
through the old valley of golden trees
in the land of elves
a young boy hated the line that destiny
wrote out on his race
he sighed for the fire
he sighed for the wind
and the rain on the face
far away from kingdom lit by the blaze
lost in a strange place
somewhere in dreams there is a way
vast towers and gardens
somewhere in dreams there is a bay
full of fantasy
dragons in my dreams
look for the glory
in the time's stream
i just can flee
dragons in my dreams
tell us the story
where the sunset beams
i will be free
and he woke one morning in elves? land
his heart was in chains
and the king of the elves couldn't understand
believed him insane
but every night his soul wished to race
through the seven seas
watching the stars in the deep space
out of his agony
in the white land of dreams there is a way
high mountain and forests
words on the wind that sweetly say
full of fantasy
dragons in my dreams
look for the glory
in the time's stream
i just can flee
dragons in my dreams
tell us the story
where the sunset beams
i will be free
you were forced to live in secret
you fled from awful fear
always hold it to your ear
and the labrys caressing your hands
with pain and sorrow the fight starts
i only wish to fade far away
your worth brings life to me
you're a deity in my dreams
you feel the power to decide
in the darkness
waiting for a sign
a sign in your hand
and one light shine on
why the mystery of goddess
is my freedom?
helm of the stars
is a spirit of truth
in my heart, in my heart
i feel so alive...with you
bodua! celtic goddess of war
blood, pain and misery within...
aine! goddess of the land
in the winter torches could be blind
a sign in your hand
and one light shine on
why the mystery of goddess
is my freedom?
helm of the stars
is a spirit of truth
in my heart, in my heart
i feel so alone...without you!
the moment came now
his brother died
and he became his people's guide
though was suspicions
of fratricide
behind him they ride
they all know the legend
who bears the ghost sword
brings the world an age end
and must be it's lord
thinks his feats the legend
in fire will record
like a wild blasphemer
out of all control
a little of a dreamer
a little a free soul
it's rome his first goal
and then, a stranger
came to the horde
unafraid of sure danger
gave the ghost sword
to the most adored
recitation
he has come already
to the city gates
his decision's made
he's not to dissuade
but the pope is ready
there to imprecate:
"don't be so steady and capitulate!"
he how speaks of crudeness
love and jesus' sake
and he feels that goodness
inside his awakes
to take what you wouldn't is
always a mistake
instrumental
lowering clouds in the sky aglow
darken my shield of victory
is my fate doomed to hell on earth?
a shift in the wind guides me to home
i am staring in the mirror now
who is that under my bloody mail?
i bury my lance and i kneel on this field
i rend the air with my old sword
i commend my soul to god
i?m fatally hurt but not by a knight
when i hear the sound of the blade
i recall all the blood shed in vain
i bury my lance and i knell on this field
i rend the air with my old sword
i commend my soul...
wherever i turn my eyes i only see the lives
i shattered and they'll never find the path of the sun
wherever i turn my head i only see the dead
i left behind, they'll never find the path of the sun
you are a part of my life
since i met you for the first time
in the sky, in the night
i will love you till i die...
the sweet door of the dreams is open again
tonight all my love will flow through your veins
you're my constant vision, reflect of my heart
i remember your eyes that never say goodbye
i want to tell you that you are my star
an eternal rainbow, an eternal sun
chorus
infinite dreams in my life
since i met you for the first time
in the sky, in the night
i will love you till i die...
your tears become the continuity of my lament
your smell becomes the continuity of my essence
i open my eyes and i don't feel the fear
when i'm close to you nothing bad happens to me
i want to tell you that you are my star
an eternal rainbow, an eternal sun
chorus
mme si nous ne sommes pas ensemble,
nous sommes un chrie o que tu sois, je serai prs de toi
chorus
along the river of fantasy we'll get to a place
which they want to see. across the valley of illusion
we'll have to climb the mountains of confusion
and challenge all the signs without breaking our union
the legend tells me that in this place
the ones who immerse in the lake
immortality will find. never ever die
run across the seas, find the brightness in the mist
following the lane, you will reach the silver lake
our journey is hard and the lake is far
we will never fall, in the strength we hold
maybe we'll never dream in this endless time
you will never win if for your goals you don't fight
although we're lost in the forest of sorrow
we'll try hard to cross the dry dune of the death
the legend tells me that in this place
the ones who immerse in the lake
imortality will find. never ever die
run across the seas, find the brightness in the mist
following the lane, you will reach the silver lake
our journey is hard and the lake is far
we will never fall, in the strength we hold
i am the loner
the gloomy mist's owner
i am the sailor
in the sea of squalor
waiting in the sand
that return your lovely light eyes
but i'm crying and dying
eternally lying
under the shower
a grave of black flower
hollow...
in my soul
the tears in my face
the rain in the sad place
my soul is kneeling
the tide brings the feelings
i could live a dream
where your spirit call on the high seas
oh! my lover, i'm lonely
time passes so slowly
my heart i bear
with pain of despair
sorrow...
in the shore
from the breeze
of the seas
the waves sing
the sweet song of your memory
in the deep
of my soul
when the sirens
of the ocean
bring the silent
i cry
in my eyes
there's a lament of misery
in my sigh
a dark misery
so i die
oh! my love
i am dreaming, darkness around
i am sailing in the ship's wound
angels screaming
in the mist out at sea
silent, blackness, sirens madness
loving, gladness, dying sadness
dreaming hollow, feeling, sorrow
waiting, drear, looking, fear
the angels are crying for me
oh! silver mirror
your cost was an error
i die of broken
my sentence was spoken
but in the cold foam
stay hopes of my soul immortal
in the twilight the sky burn
and there isn't return
only my reason
to live in this prison
waiting...
in the shore
in the silence of the darkness
close your eyes and you think
that the magic died long ago
and all grayness was grown
you will see it there
dancing in the light
trying to arrive to your soul
flying with mighty wings
you have to have faith
then mountains you'll move
you'll know that it's true
when you will look and see
chorus
in the sky
the dragon is into the fire
he's taking the night
in the sky
when your mind is far
ride your white star
you'll arrive to the light
in the sky
the way will be hard and long
but you have to be strong
the beast lurks in the shadows
waiting to drain your your life
it knocks on your door
waiting for response
take its mighty hand
you have not to fear
the magic has to live
spurting from your soul
you'll know that it's true
when you will look and see
i was to old rome
and there i did meet
my true love
back to my real home
happiness complete
soul of dove!
but i promised to her
i would return one day
to hear aloud hoorays
as emperor
return
like winds which burn
for love
like gales which shove
in my land i stayed
thinking of my fate
fixed in fire
i'd invade
to the gates
of the empire
in the olden wood
when the sun bright the dawn
i am feeling alone
lost into the infinitude
light and darkness in my mind
liquid shadows cross the place
oaks whisper like the wind
vail of tears on my face
elves sing our names
you and i have called
our dreams are enthralled
underneath eternal flames
from the bells began to chime
old ones know our destiny
real souls are out of time
ever since melancholy
demons in my mind
bind to write the world
world forevermore
horror
master of the pen
when the raven lies
sighs, but never dies
darkness
the imp of
the perverse
whisper from the drink
the mask of
the red death
hides the face of his tortured soul
chorus:
free mind confirmed
just behind reality
its kingdom is by the sea
grim rhymes of yore
were born in baltimore
the bird said: "nevermore"
he was in love for
the only cause of doom
fighting for love with
the enamoured tomb
was his love
like a dove
tender sweet and frail
like a sail
in a gale
he was the eternal lover
chorus
in the edge of knife
life in the tight rope
hope to take the slope
sorrow
in the time of tears
near the last shore
sore to take the door
sadness
the pit and
the pendulum
hang over his heart
the black cat
the oneeyed
sees his conscience beyond the wall
chorus
wars in the night
fear in my eyes
and fighting with all the warriors
keeping all the treasures
hiding the reasons
and watching the warriors falling down
i would like to be a bird
i would like to be a man
when the fire runs withe me
i will feel free again
chorus
born in the dark
fighting with us
there is no reason to let you down
come with us now
it's cold at dawn
there is no reason
born in the dark
power in my hands
fear in my veins
and calling my brothers right now
fighting with corpses
there is no return
and moving mountains with faith
i can see the light on me
i can see my destiny
when the fire runs with me
i will feel free again
chorus
old world has left in starvation and disease
fourteen ninetytwo bring a new change to see
across the ocean they would sail
following out the dark blaze
they keep the route with an endless faith
bridge:
far beyond the earth's edge
they will reach their dreams
as a privilege
sun still spreads out its beams
chorus:
with the winds of the sea
always blowing from the east
three boats dare to face
sailing through inferno's gate
just a will, a belief
which could cross the deep abyss
to discover a new world
saving humanity
suddenly a joyful cry
was heard in the advanced night
the long awaited sight
was seen below the sky
new treasures shine before my eyes
they're bright like a burning fire
i will enjoy the eternal sea of life
bridge
chorus
aventus nautarum in novan terram
argentum aurumque america
but they didn't know
that this virgin ground
was an unknown land that's overgrown
new eden's found
the lost paradise
mankind's dawn is beginning to rise
this land is wild
our boots were defiled
our dreams will be reality
the native's pain
always in vain
our glory was their agony
but when columbus told the queen
all the thing he'd seen
he had to submit and be agreed
with kingdom's greed
chorus
there was an ancient age, of the warrior, of the sage
in a remote time, when bards sang their epic rhymes
there is a gloomy land, where no lord or king stands
where misery reigns, peace and justice are in vain
a king must arrive, the most valiant knights strive
to draw excalibur from its dream in the stone's core
it's merlin's command be removed by a young hand
before the knight's ring, a boy becomes arthus the king
arthur knew greed in kingdom, pain and sorrow he will feel
after the war his former foes kneel
honour, fairness and wisdom on the round table are the rule
in camelot, are free lords and fools
the search for the grail, just the purest of the males
to see it has the right among all arthur's knights
endless was the quest because no one passed the test
and the treason came, loyal lancelot was his name
arthur knew the lie in camelot, pain and sorrow in his soul
culprits must pay for playing so foul
but the king's heart is crying
his kingdom and dream are blown away
but his sword will live, forever will stay
the king's sword... from the stone
the king's sword... he is alone
with it he'll be lord... it rules again
the king's sword... it's all in vain
young kingdoms, yougn kingdoms
prepare the crimson war
young kingdoms, young kingdoms
command the righteous law
the fall of melnibone
imrryr towest in the quiet night sleep
at the northeast part of the turquoise boiling sea
cold wind scream over finest gargoyles high
carrying sings in the dawn that frightens sky
golden troops may compare a rising storm
and the entire will is on tarkan, dyvim's core,
purple towns are attacking from the shore
outer walls and the labyrinth unknown
chorus:
young kingdoms, yougn kingdoms
prepare the crimson war
young kingdoms, young kingdoms
command the righteous law
dragon isle, oh! dragon isle
sadness dims your witching eye
fancy dream of xiombarg
mighty falls in raging hush
elric guides all the seamen from the bridge
from his leader ship and the laughin' of a bitch
arches shoot from the topwalls in the crew,
killing men with the anguish of the loot
tarkan falls as the stumbles on the edge
just to find the hell dying of his broken neck
imrryr burns and sorrow has no end
fury grows as the princess is just dead
chorus
stormbringer, demon grabber with runes
stormbringer, blackest blade with looms
stormbringer, feed with mourning souls
your wicked evil, sounding tunes
mighty runes, melnibone
can you hear the pray for your burning death?
pearly halls, your magic sight
are the crushed of lay on your bloody earth?
dready shores, melnibone
can you bear the threat of that flaming flags?
dragon isle, your sturdy chime
all is lost right now and prince yykoon lurks
arioch! can you feel my pain
from yor throne of holy lord?
am i crying in vain despair
my fate weaved by this broadsword?
i cannot see life or light

must i be forever lone?
beloved cymoril is gone?
have you really found the death
by the evil on my hand?
chorus
this goddamn life
this endless time
is writing into my eyes
learn to forget
living in calm day by day
my days
why am i afraid of sunny light?
tell me why all the memories calls me?
the tears forever coming me
no more tears flowing through my skin
i'll feel my name
i'll find the way
the way that lived yesterday
i lost the time
what have i done with my life?
but what have i done with this life?
i run from the day trying to die
where i painful mind was whole night?
remember all my past time
when the future is waiting for me
i am lying on this ground among memories
can the ocean of time claim to own me?
to own me?
this goddamn time
this endless life
is writing into my eyes
i lost the time
what have i done with my life?
but what have i done with this life?
i run from the day trying to die
where i painful mind was whole night?
remember all my past time
when the future is waiting for me
i am lying on this ground among memories
can the ocean of time claim to own me?
to own me?
why am i afraid of sunny light?
tell me why all the memories calls me?
the tears forever coming me
no more tears flowing through my skin
heart, i feel distress in my heart
but i have gone to hell for a smile
i hear voices from the past
time, i only need more time
remember all my past time
when the future is waiting for me
i am lying on this ground among memories
can the ocean of time claim to own me?
to own me?
the empire beyond the seas
when sun does not decease
glory to my king
greatest is our land
honour and glory to my good king
king of both the land and sea
we wish may god save my king
for ever i will the prince
from uruguay to philippines
but my sigh of remorse
just prays god for peace and force
tears in my eyes never convince
but more defy with weight of sins
to reply to my pain
with more punish once again
but the pride
to decide
my people's fate
makes me fight
for their right
at any rate
because spain is my kingdom
like a golden dream of greatness
our olden land will sing
songs of the glory
songs of our king
o, philip the second
by our lord enthroned
with all power
i can't fall power
it's the hour
death is around
the prince is dead laying in his bed
is this, lord, my reward
mourning and pain the king's insane
my places will be escorial
built, in place esoterical
the earth and heaven will be one
forgetting the loss of my son
magia, sueos, son sus dueos, sombras, gritos en sus ritos
in my nightmares, i see a black dog
keeper of the hell's door
coming our from fog
whispers of the dream of solomon
rojas llamas, negras damas, duelo eterno, cielo, infierno
the horoscopes foretell
hanna be my queen
and from our love spell
an heir's been foreseen
never dies
the spirit of sacrifice
of my king who gives
his life so that his dream lives
for his land
he makes what can't understand
no one useless him
god and him
life for revenge!
i have survived for my iron will
and for a reason i just can see
allthough i feel myself sad and ill
dark thoughts encourage me to get me free
i need my life
just for revenge
its worth is only in the justice it makes
life to avenge
life to perform a fake
in the dead shape
i escape
to fulfill my duty
to fake my false friends
to their end
damning my wife's beauty
changing my name
i proclaim
with a manifesto
that from this time
for good i'm
count of montecristo
play the drums of heaven, flee from here to a remote land
the scourge of your people threatens to destroy the man
when the swords plunge into your souls, you will rest in peace
now i want to pass my sentence on your holy priest
save you from evil purify your hearts
it is high time you start to depart
oh lord! nobody is blameless, thy will be done
my god! nobody is safe from the rage of your son
your wounds are bleeding for the unspeakable sins
how long have you been keeping the holy keys?
the light of the sun is suddenly ebbing away
the earth will be embraced by the flames in this day
even the most gallant of my heirs among the men
will be terrified of the beginning of the end
oh lord! nobody is blameless, thy will be done
my god! nobody is safe from the rage of your son
your wounds are bleeding for the unspeakable sins
how long are you praying for me?
you will know that it's me when i turn my back on you
i will put the bodys of your sons inside their tombs
i will throw your rotten bones into a sea of lies
my black soul will be your curse for the rest of your lives
oh lord! nobody is blameless, thy will be done
my god! nobody is safe from the rage of your son
your wounds are bleeding for the unspeakable sins
how long have your been keeping the holy keys?
pure dark badness
a black cold sadness
falling into
hole of madness dying to
step into the city
breaking out from silence
iron gods
pouring flaming violence
sirens, don't stop crying
really crying loud
murder now
is allowed
hissing arrow
soaked in fire
wrapped in wire
the souls cry
from hell!
right from hell!
crazy driven horden of brothers
money given to slay others
richness striven between smothers
is paid in blood
keep on fighting no surrender
judgement coming no defender
just believing the pretender
evil rising into
a spiral of madness
for all will be sentenced
and this way
justice will take vengeance
power does conspire
against innocence
wrapped in wire
the souls cry
soul of mine,
when road's lonely,
she came to me in the skyline,
her look was divine
her black hair
danced with the wind,
and the cold air
of autumn
played with leaves while my soul skinned
her eyes were my glare
her sweet voice
pronounced my name
my soul was a choice
she called me
while her white dress was my blame
she could be my dame
chorus
grey
dusk is, over the way
white ghost,
in my heart,
my loving soul was hurt,
dark hopes beyond my mind.
and so i resigned
all for her cold dream's love
i went there
each evening
my only care,
don't see her!
while my heart played in a swing
falling in despair
then i dreamed
with her sad death,
and my soul screamed
harrowing
while she gave me her cold breath,
she kissed me
chorus
but grey
dusk is, over the way
white ghost,
in my heart, my loving soul was hurt,
dark hopes beyond my mind.
and so i resigned
all for her cold dream's love
instrumental
my sorrow is like
leaves flying in the air
when the wind strikes
blowing everywhere
and i can't stay living in this tearful valley
so i just pray for having all the force
to be a stream leading its course
flowing up to its source
bridge i:
but my love is for the only light
but my heart goes on standing right
chorus:
if i could flee
from my sorry thoughts
like the rivers running slope down at last to be free
when i see
lovers who can dream
with sweet fancies that will never be
a truth for me
nobody can live
twice in just one time
neither can give
twice love in its prime
but can't prevent feeling to surrender to love
so i feel myself prisoner of sin
when i give to the earth my skin
and my soul to the wind
bridge ii:
but my love is keeping watch the night
but my heart cries the eternal fight
chorus
bridge i
chorus
when day is out, i can see in the sky
plentyful forest made with the stars
in cold night, i can feel the nearby
goddess of asters no matter thou art so far
bridge
but in my sorrow i need to see
beatiful sunsets, precious to thee
and in my travels when they're too long
i'm just pay worship with this sweet song
chorus:
everytime i gaze the blue sky
filling thy grace with love tears my eyes
in thy face see the space
in my cry, hear a sight
praying for thy light
a during ship crossing the sky by day
sailing the morning. light is its trade
a silver ship for love starting the chase
when the night comes the light dies away
bridge
chorus
instrumental
born in a sorry cot, left on the stairs of the cold stone
damned to be scorned, in darkness, damned to be alone
taken by the church, his soul will be slave of god
in the belfry's beauty is his figure something odd.
we see the hunchback in notre dame
dancing on the tallest towers
arcades and spires, filling his heart,
deep like the choir, fine like the art
is the place my cell, is it?
is god's home my hell?
oh, my body prisions my poor soul,
until i toll!
i am grim, full of gloom
in my dim gothic tomb
but the bells in my heart chime for ever
with the ding that belongs
to the king of their songs
i'm the sound of notre dame
in the wheel of life he is a horror for the crowd,
when will be the time he'll see the sun between the clouds?
looking at the bells he thinks about his tragic fate
wants to be a rock or metal like his souless mates
we hear the hunchback in notre dame
crying on the tallest towers
gargoyles and columns, his relity
chants wich are solemn, his agony
is this place my cell, is it?
is god's home my hell?
oh, my body imprisons my poor soul
until i toll!
i am grim, full of gloom
in my dim gothic tomb
but the bells in my heart chime for ever
with the ding that belongs
to the king of their songs
i'm the sound of notre dame
walking through the lane
when conforms our life
we play a fool's game
to survive
pleasure enclosed me
enbracing with loving arms
pain came to me
with great harm
brigde i:
have you ever wonder
are we just victims of fate
fed with the seeds of hate?
why must be wander
towards the dark unknown gate
although our will is great?
chorus:
ol by the strange paths of destiny
searching out hard my hidden place
faces weave the life cord of humanity
in the end their last verdict can't wait
goddess of fortune be by my side
mother experience keep me alive
unyielding time now has just decide
if i'll survive
i saw a siren
in my lonely way
lost in her silence
we turn away
bridge ii
disgrace has found me
it would try to make the fall
but hope kept me from all
anger had chained me
but the siren set me free
diving into life's sea
chorus
i was born in france, called the "maid of orleans"
led by the voices of the saints
i went to the court dressed in men's clothes
to save my people from the yoke
i was given troops to destroy the english roots
and to crown the dauphin at reims
i'm not a man searching the glory
i'm just the hand chosen to fight
it's a long way to our freedom
i was betrayed. i'm burning at the stake
my own blood sold me in the battlefield
charles the king made no attemps to save me
i won't be free till the day of my death
the pyre is light. i see the end
i'm not a man searching the glory
i'm just the hand chosen to fight
it's a long way to our freedom
i was betrayed. i'm burning at the stake
i'd rather die than live chained in this cell
i hold to what i have already said
i won't be free till the day of my death
the pyre is light. i see the end
i'm not a man searching the glory
i'm just the hand chosen to fight
it's a long way to our freedom
i was betrayed. i'm burning at the stake
you don't lie, you don't fight
don't people see the light
you don't gaze the mean face
don't try to pray
just to save your illusions
to save your shame
now your life is impregnated of blame
please help me, or kill me
but don't bury my soul
i'm dreaming, i'm screaming
full of grief
i'll be condemned without mercy
without a soul
buy i've a nice hope
chorus
the wind in my hair
the sun under my veil
i'll go though
the road is hard and long
thousand of questions
and only one answer
my anger is in the heart of stone
i'm sneaking, i'm creeping
i'm needing all my faith
i'm sinning i'm learning
full of grief
i'll be condemned without mercy
without a soul
buy i've a nice hope
chorus
don't hit me, don't save me
what is my destiny?
i'm sighing, i'm crying
full of grief
i'll be condemned without mercy
without a soul
buy i've a nice hope
chorus
quest for the eternal fame
which gets the men immortal
glory for our names
gained in the battle by knight that legend will acclaim
we don't mind the sacrifice, it's a low price
for being in the heaven's hall
just to see the paradise with loving eyes
when death makes its mournful call
justice we must defend we're the law's lance
our deeds and virtues hold a beatiful romance
but we can't forget compassion's our end
so we'll have temperance
quest for the eternal fame
which gets the men immortal
glory four our names
gained in the battle by knight that legend will acclaim
love must be the guide keeping off pride
humility leads us
in the quest for our inside as testified
by the angels of light
honour and honesty fill our heart
in the middle of the battle fear is put apart
with the sound of blades' steel our qualities
make the war be an art
quest for the eternal fame
which gets the men immortal
glory for our names
gained in the battle by knight that legend will acclaim
in the autumn's wind
there's a melody
epic ballads that the bards sing
rhymes that in the air
want to manifest with glee
valor comes from the king of kings
sacrifium, honestas, compassio,
virtus, humilitas, honor
justice we must defend we're the law's lance
our deeds and virtues hold a beatiful romance
but we can't forget compassion's our end
so we'll have temperance
quest for the eternal fame
which gets the men inmortal
glory four our names
gained in the battle by knight that legend will acclaim
i see the eyes of the darkness, beyond the fire
where the starts seem to be crying
in this green valley, i let go out my desire
for some peace and quiet i'm dying
my song is strong over the gale
like a nightfall rending the air
cloaked in the light of the blaze, i am waiting
for the return of my fate
i never try to find and nothing makes me cry
where i could spend my life
by the sea, in my sleep, i can breathe the cold wind
and this frozen wind recalls me that i have never dreamed
i still can't awake. there's no sun there's no day
pierced by the lance of the pain... i'm not afraid!
i feel like a solitary desert swept by the wind
here, sweet voices whisper me
everything is still the same in my dreams
i don't want to fall asleep
my song is strong over the gale
like a nightfall rending the air
cloaked in the veil of the night, i'm lying
i sense the end in my mind
i never try to find and nothing makes me cry
where i could spend my life
by the sea, in my sleep, i can breathe the cold wind
and this frozen wind recalls me that i have never dreamed
i still can't awake. there's no sun there's no day
pierced by the lance of the pain... i'm not afraid!

aches to be away
eternal wisdom
in glorious kingdom

it's the sea of life a nightmare
for the searching and ever coming back.
in the middle of the empty nowhere
in a deep hole that is getting black
the sea
is a pool full of tears that shed
my solitude that was thus fed
with the outrage voices uttered by the sirens.
the sea
is the vast void from i can't flee
is the smooth mirror of my glee
like liquid stuff of blurred time
chorus
in the unstill bluish sea
searching a port that cares for me
coming back to get free
my tortured soul
i can ride
in love the waves in glide
in love i'm looking for a reason to hold on
hearing in the sea an old tone
of mermaids at my side
while the waves make my ocean tide
the sea
is where i just try to make sense
of this life fabric thick and dense
where i can feel distress and dismay for me.
the sea
is the great well of fantasy
whose source is our melancholy
from which springs up and flows

"you stand before this court, accused of heresy and witch craft. how do you plead?"
"not guilty!"
"guilty!"
our tongues they could not silence with their malicious lies
their unforgotten violence, remember those who died
and as my flesh is put to fire i hear their voices still
their unjust accusations demanding that i am killed
"we shall show no mercy to heathen such as thee
who stand accused and have refused the church's clemency
your wicked acts are endless through the crimes we cannot name
innocent or guilty proved, we'll burn you just the same"
burning, into the fire
burning, a funeral pyre
burning, into the fire
burning, a funeral pyre
this selfrighteous inquisition is a plague upon our land
as false as the confessions they force from shattered hands
"we shall show no mercy to heathen such as thee

your wicked acts are endless through the crimes we cannot name
innocent or guilty proved, we'll burn you just the same"
burning, into the fire

abused my broken body is cleansed by righteous flame,
their god a 'god of mercy' yet in whose name i slain.
my innocence the victim of their superstitious fears
religious persecution for the past three hundred years
preaching peace and mercy 'neath the shadow of the knife
a papal reign of terror, slaughter in the name of christ
and as my flesh is put to fire i hear their voices still
their unjust accusations demanding that i am killed
"we shall show no mercy to heathen such as thee

foul snake despair
where once you darkened gardens
another coils there
where twice you sliced all hope from me
and left these present scars
an insane love now burns above
the weft of incandescent stars
hilt your dripping fangs that range
skywards to rend apart
i might have sang of wings unchained
but long before i locked my heart
for gabrielle
a fit and perfect stitch of foreign parts
whose beauty fostered poets
whose laugh like silver belts
thawed your bitter winter from my path
gabrielle
foul snake despair
where once you peddled secrets
another spoils there
with speech that sweetens drowning
in deep lagoons of eyes
and legs that begged apologies
for lengths that mesmerized
spare your hissing sentiments
for her fee welts more than thine
though no malice she weans
just a palace of dreams
where windswept chambers pine
for gabrielle
whose hairspun onyx is run with gold
her rouge lips smack of dark blood
her name in whisper rolls
forever on my tongue
lest her memory dissolve
gabrielle
oh, gabrielle
once crucified
i would have died
a thousand more times
just to feel her breath
on my neck as a fervent lover
to drown her sighs
in floods of tears so well refined
and blind from spying her
in the arms of others
gabrielle
gabrielle
buried inside
where she's all but mine
save for those that dine
oh her, on her perfect carcass
gabrielle
gabrielle
foul snake despair
where once you wreaked my misery
another toils there
for long lost gabrielle
whose nightly spreading grin
persists in other faces
by whom i'm slowly taken in
absinthe with faust
pour the emerald wine
into crystal glasses
we will touch the divine
through kisses catharsis
let us pitch to the sevenyear itch
of the ultradecadent
to a tainted world and the painted girls
that our fantasies spent
tripping through boudoirs laced with opiate themes
sipping the bizarre, tasting copious dreams
a toast to those most sacrilegious of days
where for every whim won
one soon repays
we touched the stars
that now laugh from afar
at we, the damned
the damned
the damned
the damned
we have spent our time
drenched in opulent splendour
but when midnight chimes
will gilded souls surrender?
let us drink on the giddying brink
of pools of excrement
all manner of shit for the glamour and glitz
mephistopheles lent
i remember the night as if it were engraved
a bright marble bridge stretched across the dark waves
to the shore from the moon and by her grace
came that erudite stranger
that fucker
come my friend, to fate let's raise
two finger shots at this our last soiree
for tomorrow i fear
swoops all too deadly near
this precipitous weir to hell's high gate
we touched the stars
that now laugh from afar
at we, the damned
the damned
the damned

still fuckin' here, are ya? well i couldn't tell it. this is a track from our first promo video, the one with the dwarves and the amputees and the freaks in it, and that was just the fucking band!
seven brides serve me seven sins
seven seas writhe for me
from orient gates to r'lyeh
abydos to thessaly
and sirens sing from stern
but now i cease to play
for i yearn to return
to woodland ferns
where herne and his wild huntress lay
now the tidal are turning
spurning the darkness
the great purgations of distinguished tours
are but stills in time
to the thrill that i'm
once more
heading to the bedding
of her english shores
the wind bickered in satanic mill sails
eyes flickered in deep thickets of trees
and mists clung tight in panic to vales
when brigantia spoke her soul to me
from imbolg to bealtaine
lughnasadh to samhain feasts
i heard her lament as season's blent
together a chimerical beast
now the tidal are turning
churning in darkness
the celebrations of extinguished wars
are but stills in time
to the chill that climbs
once more
dreading the red weddings
on her english shores
gone are the rustic summers of my youth
cruel winter cut their sacred throats
with polished scythes that reap worldwide
pitch black skies and forest smoke
and the hosts that i saw there
drones of carrion law
drove the ghosts of my forbears
to rove and rally once more
one of her sons from the vast farflung
come home to rebuild
the rampant line of the leonine
risen over pestilent fields
now the tidal are turning
burning in darkness
the salvation of her hungry sword
shalt spill like wine
from the hills to chines
that pour
spreading her beheadings
on these english shores
for the hosts that i saw there
drones of carrion law
drove the ghosts of my forbears
to rove and rally once more
this is a waking for england
from it's reticent doze
this is a waking for england
lest hope and glory are regarded as foes
a celebration of the damned
the unfettered few who choose to roam
sharing more than sexual excess
sowing more than vexing stones
favourite haunts of depravation
where the morning fears to tread
covenant revere the sullen cain
strike the tethered liar dead
dark solstice fever burns in me
like the tugging of my veins to feed
ravaging ravenlust
unbridled at dusk
there hides a secret
deeply twined inside of her mind
a tried and confined egret
that pines to fly south
to this mouth of mine
pity
too long have these emotions
like potions, made me
a sole castellan
trusted to keep
the weight of oceans
from her rusted gates of sleep
a dreaming angel
lying curled in the circles of hell
i must protect her
watch her back for any cracks to occur
for in the witching hour
she slips into the underworld
a pearled persephone
deflowered by the powers
hat around her
down her
whirl
doomed to damn the rift
across the shifting abyss
with her body and it's gift?
my filthy little secret
i serve her slender hope
to preserve mankind from old ghosts
disturbed though by recurring crimes
i sense that dead
might be best for both
pity
too long have these emotions
like potions, made me
a sole castellan
posted to keep
slow wheels in motion
from the human race to beat
without her there
my nymphetamine with the faraway stare
thin walls would crumble
horrors would corroborate from dogstar lairs
for in the dead of the night
she spasms with orgasmic flare
this reamed demeter
with poseidons there inside her
too appeased to grieve our air
doomed to dam the rift
across the shifting abyss
with her body and it's gift?
my filthy little secret
forever sworn to keep it
my filthy little secret
pity
too long this urchin princess
has incensed, made me
a wanton felon
searching for the key
to loose her harness
and set desires lurching free
without her there
my nymphetamine with the faraway stare
thin walls would crumble
horrors would corroborate from dogstar lair
but in her room at night
i care not for the underworld
slathering and gathering emboldened reichs
to breach, to teach
a dread thereafter
i would risk all this
for one minute of bliss
with her body and it's gift
my filthy little secret
forever sworn to keep it
my filthy little secret
i know a deeper beauty shines
beyond the veil
her roots and creepers mine
as the worms beneath rise
a voyeur in league with the great thief night
in an overthrow of women light
slid in to rob the prayers
she whispered to the air with thin deliberation
spare me from the wolves
clawing past my door
tear me from the ghouls
that start to gnaw my fingers
following her heart
and every beat that spoke
i kissed her risen, naked
soft white throat
soft white throat
incense lit at perfection's feet
has never burnt so sickly sweet
as the fragrance of her breath
when her lips met death with such imagination
bear me to the moon
the dour toll of bells
scare me with their boon
of winters bitter graveyards
swallowing her fear
i veered beneath her coat
of soft white meat on
soft white throat
crepuscular, the lust in her
went supernova
setting maps aflame
before her veins ran colder
and muscular, the final thrust
in her spilled over
covering her back
i saw an angel lift her
coma
i fell to eyes
of a bestial past that once
teaching grief through jaded pupils
now shone like celestial glass in hell
in hell
and doused in the glow from her parting gift
never there lay, with curves like snowdrifts
a beauty so frozen in bliss
slumped to warm the dead to a standing ovation
spare me from the wolves
clawing past my door
tear me from the ghouls
that start to gnaw my fingers
following her heart
and every beat that spoke
i kissed her risen, naked
soft white throat
soft white throat
crepuscular, the lust in her
went supernova
setting maps aflame
before her veins ran colder
and muscular, the final thrust
in her spilled over
smothering her cracks
i was the devil on her shoulder
dear lord i cry, before i die
grant me the taste of love
one final time lest i should hide
when seraph call me from above
and should remorse not stay my course
from debt, addresses wept
will ask no more of you my lord
save that my soul in hell is kept
black is the night, metal we fight
power amps set to explode.
energy screams, magic and dreams
satan records the first note.
we chime the bell, chaos and hell
metal for maniacs pure.
faster than steel, fortune on wheels
brain haemorrhage is the cure.
for black metal
lay down your souls to the gods rock 'n roll
freaking so wild, nobodys mild
giving it all that you got.
wild is so right, metal tonight
faster than over the top.
open the door, enter hell's core
black is the code for tonight.
atomic force, feel no remorse
crank up the amps now its night
black metal x5
lay down your souls to the gods rock 'n roll
metal ten fold through the deadly black hole
riding hell's stallions bareback and free
taking our chances with raw energy
come ride the night with us
rock hard and fight
united my legions we stand
freak hard and wild for us
give up your soul
live for the quest satan's band
against the odds, black metal gods
fight to achieve our goal
casting a spell, leather and hell
black metal gods rock 'n roll
building up steam, nuclear screams
warheads are ready to fight
black leather hounds, faster than sound
metal our purpose in life
fuck everything
that fucking lives
black metal
lay down your souls to the gods rock 'n roll

i've had nothing but bad luck
since the day i saw the cat at my door
so i came into you sweet lady
answering your mystical call
crystal ball on the table
showing the future,the past
same cat with them evil eyes
and i knew it was a spell she cast
she's just a devil woman
with evil on her mind
beware the devil woman
she's gonna get you
she's just a devil woman
with evil on her mind
beware the devil woman
she's gonna get you from behind
give me the ring on your finger
let me see the lines on your hand
i can see me a tall dark stranger
giving you what you hadn't planned
i drank the potion she offered me
i found myself on the floor
then i looked into those big green eyes
and i wondered what i'd come there for
she's just a devil woman
with evil on her mind
beware the devil woman
she's gonna get you
she's just a devil woman
with evil on her mind
beware the devil woman
she's gonna get you from behind
if you're out on a moonlit night
be careful of them neighborhood strays
of a lady with long black hair
tryin' to win you with nymphetamine ways
crystal ball on the table
showing the future,the past
same cat with them evil eyes
you'd better get out of there fast
she's just a devil woman
with evil on her mind
beware the devil woman
she's gonna get you
she's just a devil woman
with evil on her mind
beware the devil woman
she's gonna get you

candelabra snuffed prey  silhouette wedded
nightfall take my hand
seduce me with silky timbred limbs
grant me thy dark command
over the peaks framing tapestries
of thick forest, dusk has filled
with lucifugous kisses enwreathed in mist
creeping like violations from the shadows
to kill
lucretia
is my love in vein
when thy tears bleed sweeter
thank the midsummer rain?
bewinged, infested belfries
toll o'er the sobbing throng
a writhe of lethargic, terrored nudes
whipped and welted neath the barbed windsong
in saddean paradise
ancestral legacies linger on
i am he
the crowned and conquering darkness
satan robed in ecumenical filth
livid bacchus sustained by bridal echelons of sylph
this wintry eve when the snow glistens deep
and sharpened turrets wed the jewelless skies
i shrug off the shroud of preternatural sleep
enbroided by these words malaresia scribed....
"beauty slept and angels wept
for her immortal soul
in this response, all evil chose
to claim her for their very own"
carpathia
the pleasured dead speak of her
in necromantic tongue
when ambered daylights are done
masterbating in their graves
on her zenith to come
this catafalque night when awed stars report
their absence from the heavenly brow
crippled seraph shalt cower in illustrious courts
whilsts the cloaked maelstrom resounds throughout
"how the storm it fulfills
my heart though unhealed
celestial knives ebonied
and wild woods thrill
yet far fiercer still
her lustre eviscerates me"
carpathia
priapic lovers twist in concert with her
covenants are struck, jagged lightning fellates
the path towards the castle weary innocence takes
i rule as master here
where feral hordes impart my temper
love sank wounded when i, betrayed
saw death etch cruelly, upon my lineage
"usher the spite seething draconist
and commit this world to thy ancient
sovereignty"
erunescent veil descend
psalmed sunset thus portends
and laid to rest, i now am blessed
with this darkness, forever more
supreme vampiric evil
pour the emerald wine
into crystal glasses
we will touch the divine
through kissed catharsis
let us pitch to the seven year itch
of the ultradecadent
to a tainted world and the painted girls
that our fantasies spent
tripping through boudoirs laced with opiate themes
sipping the bizzare, tasting copious dreams
a toast to those most sacriligeous of days
where for every whim won
one soon repays
we touched the stars
that now laugh from afar
at we, the damned
the damned
we have spent our time
drenched in opulent splendour
but when midnight chimes
will gilded souls surrender?
let us drink on the giddying brink
of pools of excrement
all manner of shit for the glamour and glitz
mephistopheles lent
i remember the night as if it were engraved
in a bright marble bridge stretched across dark waves
to the shore from the moon and by her grace
came that erudite stranger
that fucker
come my friend, to fate let's raise
two finger shots at this our last soiree
for tomorrow i fear
swoops all too deadly near
this precipitous weir to hell's high gate
dim the lights, wrong the rites
toss the puerile cross away
we are gashing from a venomous womb
burning bright, dead of night
pyres stain a milky way
lust is splashing the dark side of the moon
in the samhain mist
we lay in welcome by the western gate
with the five fold kiss
for every soul returning
from the fecund abyss
where nature's travesties congregate
with a stone cold wish
to see the wicker man burning
the wind, she whispers
through the graveyards of our hearts
wreathed in dreams
as she weaves her witchcraft
we breathe, enamoured
of the conquering dark
medusa and hemlock
harvest past, fires cast
ashen shades this halloween
we are set now to beherit the earth
widdershins, death begins
to fashion fete to gallow scenes
sprits rising to discredit rebirth
in the samhain mist
we lay in welcome by the western gate
with the five fold kiss
for every soul returning
from the fecund abyss
where nature's travesties congregate
with a stone cold wish
to see the wicker man burning
the wind, she flitters
through the forest of our hearts
wreathed in leaves
as she weaves her witchcraft
we breathe, enamoured
of the conquering dark
i will trace the knot of serpents in your hair
plot your face, then ascending marble stares
you shall pluck me, masked, from rosesindespair
tasting my blood
that runs from worming tongue like prayer
under pagan veneer snakes a fear
that makes the stars
grieve, just to be
uncharted on this eve
when part of me chars a path
through your heavenly constellations
medusa and hemlock
back to black, hinges crack
rituals call obscenities
sheets of demons rush insanity skies
tread the salt the dead exult
preachers beg our clemency
seeking warmth in humanity's eyes
we who kept the candle by the vault
we who kept the candle on the cult
death, spirit me away
my anguished soul doth strain
on taut and twisted reins
yet, insatiate i still remain
like a proud, unfalled star
that dares thee from afar
to calm my thund'rous heart
else, rend it's knots apart
so i may never sing
of jewelled skies o'er my strings
and love, a wanton thing
can plunge on burnt, black wings
to hang amid the thorns
in scarlet, like velvet worn
about the clouded moon
who wanes in solitude
i am alone
thirsting for the dark
that lurks beneath marbled stone
what black witchcraft
shalt prise thee from thy dreams
and what perverse worldstrategy
will wend it's way with thee from sleep?
"rouse my disease
and with cadent naked dance i shalt teach
thee wisdom of darkness
from earth and red sea
light bearing samael
coalesce with me"
twilight
through pagan city gates
bred shadows play like twining snake
by candlelight
thanateros rites
death seduced and chaos wakes
obsession grips, blindragon fever
in throes of scythed orgasm, eros dies
and saturn rapes faith's lovelorn diva
upon a cyprean altar, stripped bare for sacrifice
virtue births a demon
pandora's box, unhinged, sets loose the night
winged lilith born for want of eden
fanning plumes of harlotry
like pearls before the desert swine
the skies, they darken
and the oceans part
storm forth indignant kraken
reborn venus as thou art
feasting at my banquet
of saturnalia
i call thee having wrestled
the tides from lonely diana
"for thee endymion
i forsake the cerements of this starflung tomb"
bewithus come
unveil the ancient flame
throw the cats our enemies
desire's menstrual strain
eastern devil eyes
a cruel erotic plague
the shekhina is in exile
and the israelites enslaved to shame
midnight
jerusalem
a tenebrous phantasy
revelates to men
their celestial walls crumble
when walks the xul
born to the scarlet whore in babylon
the centuries of wait have all but gone
behold dark beauty stirs to conquer on and on
now worship everything
instrumental
i bled on a pivotal stretch
like a clockwork christ
bears sore stigmata, bored
and as i threw job, i drove
myself to a martyred wretch
to see if i drew pity
or pretty litanies from the lord
so the plot sickened
with the coming of days
ill millennia thickened
with the claret i sprayed
and though they saw red
i left a dirty white stain
a splintered know in the grain
on eden's marital aid
so glad for the madness
i walked the walls, naked to the moon
in sodom and babylon
and through rich whores and corridors
of the vatican, i led a sordid borgia on
i read the urilia text
so that mortals wormed
as live bait for the dead
and as i broke hope, i choked
another pope with manna peel
dictating to de sade
in the dark entrails of the bastille
and as he wrote, i smote
a royal blow to the heads of france
and in the sheen of guillotines
i saw others, fallen, dance
i was an incurable
necromantic old fool
a phagadaena that crawled
drooling over the past
a rabid wolf in shawl
a razor's edge to the rule
that the stars overall
were never destined to last
so glad for the madness
i furnaced dreams, a poet, for of sleep
turning sermons with the smell
on witchfinder fingers
where bad memories lingered
burning, as when dante was freed to map hell
i sired schemes and the means
to catch sight of the seams
and the vagaries in between
and midst the lips and the curls
of this cunt of a world
in glimpses, i would see
a nymph with eyes for me
eyes of fire that set all life aflame
lights that surpassed art
in sight, that no intense device of pain
could prise their secrets from my heart
i knew not her name
though her kiss was the same
without a whisper of shame
as either virtue or sin's
and pressed to her curve
i felt my destiny swerve
from damnation reserved
to a permanent grin
so glad for the madness
forgive the day's
last serenades
her skies they bruise like nordic women
deep crimson stains
that death would claim
his robes of office swim in
as would i
for his dark eye
has fixed, a basilisk, a scythe
on charred remains
with shared disdain
for those i chose to mortify
their cries
have paralysed
and the smoke has choked these vistas
but still i lie
though tears have died
on the grave of my clarissa
a verse for her whispered to the earth
a lover's curse is a seethrough coffin
praises her curves so oft concurred
though she was?
no snow white on the night she died
her shadower's boon when the moon glazed over
lipped with blood and secrets pried
for on and in they spread her wide
that seraph bride
the devil's pride
shalt soon avenge with swift reprise
but they would writhe
for my dark eye
bewitched, was fixed like mordecai's
on esther's reign
and in this vein
i saw their lust still stain her thighs
their cries
have paralysed
and the smoke has choked these vistas
but still i lie
though tears have died
on the grave of my clarissa
beneath these trees where the mist enwreathes
her spirit flees, seeing chains of torches
a fleeting kiss stirring leaves of poetry?
i was?
no dark knight, breaking men like ice
i was like a lycanthrope until the moon glazed over
lipped with blood and last goodbyes
now i dream
enwrapt in pure clouds of the sweetest oblivion
where beauty streams
freed from the teeth of those beasts that had come
to tear out her spells
in red lettered cells
wherein even the crown prince of hell
come out of his arrogant shell
would falter to better
but her face soon dispels
and as black feathers fell
from heaven's smoke
so i woke to insanity
her exquisite corpse
found fit for their sport
of course
would burn on the morrow with me?
and there on this night
strung up in my sight
naked she sways
displayed for their vulgar delight
i scream through my bars at the stars
that for these crimes of mine solace me
i will fear not the flames
that to passion are tame
not nearly the same searing pain
i pray as held sway upon losing her
nor the mettle of roars
that will settle like ashes and scores
as with our ghosts in the fog
when we both turn no more
oh, listen to them
the children of the night
what sweet music they make
may dreams be brought
that i might reach
the gentle strains
of midnight speech
and frozen stars
that gild the forest floor
through the swirling snow
volkh's children come
to run with me, to hunt as one
to snatch the lambs of christ
from where they fall
from where they fall
herodias and i have led a phantom cavalcade
through veiled and pagan history where superstitions reigned
and christendom sought to pervert, but poets of my name
sang of penumbral victories that sorcery had claimed
the graal and mighty caliburn as votive offerings
to an england rearisen under vast majestic wings
these are the shores whereto my soul
blood drenched and unredeemed
shalt seek solace in secrets told
through the whispers of a dream
from the woods pendragonborn, i rose arcturius
a proud, audacious king mantled in the
vehemence of lust
death and destiny undaunted me, i drew a throne divided
in awe of the glorious battles won, my dark goddess provided
then treachery, a wingless beast, came crawling to my court
and now i lie at cursed camlann, from wounds a traitor wrought
i fear the augean light
is sweeping through camelot
how bittersweet my triumphs seem,
now autumnal leaves succumb to frost
morganna art thou near me?
languid, i wend my path to grave
cast my sword to the sulphyd grasp
of the naiad neath the silvered lake
when waters stirred lay silent
mistress let the mists descend
thy tears cannot thaw death's cold heart
his sombre gaze defies legend
more so than thine, else thy dewlidded eyes
art for the banshees song
or our souls entwined like vein upon
the haunted shores of avalon
the haunted shores of avalon
bury me in velvet dream
lest i unduly wake
and seek to reconcile my thirst
with the cowardly tailors of my fate
unleash mastiffs of snarling night
to overthrow, plague and burn
as slumber lures me 'mongst the dead
to scheme of my return
archaic ghostly echoes breathe like thunder of the storm
a tempest fools miscall divine as they crouch awaiting dawn
their ignorance has forged for me over
centuries a sword
burnished to flash like lightning on the precipice of war
the wolves are dead in albion whilst the
passive flocks roam free
this my penetrant spearhead shalt pierce these foul,
trespassing breeds
i have awoken from the past
glenfully with the shadows over england's bitter skies
i prize mine wounds in a soil sweated drink
remember me as king when i cradle hell to stars
like lovers in my arms, nestled vipers to my breast
venom forces workthius arts of devil's and priestess
thus i shall rule anew through the sinews of a song
played upon a storm
by the ghosts of avalon
and all in league will bow to me, from death they shall ascend
to whisper weals of war to stir the dark one in men
the principle black metal masterplan
rallying war speech... cronos
"i have awoken from the past
glenfully with the shadows over england's bitter skies
i prize mine wounds in a soil sweated drink
remember me as king when i cradle hell to stars
like lovers in my arms, nestled vipers to my breast

you thought it was gone
but the fire goes on
and i thought you knew me
i told you before
'til i settle the score
that i'll never run free
i have enough pain and anger in my brain
to last many lifetimes
yet still it grows, and the more that it shows
i won't have peace of mind
the fire, the fire still burns
i have a dream
and as strange as it seems
there's no embers glowing
the fire's gone out and there's no need to shout
'cause no anger's showing
but it's not true, nothing i ever do
seems to ease my fury
get out of my way
i'm the hangman today
and the judge and jury
the fire, the fire still burns
mother of abominations
our lady overkill
smothering the congregation
grips the cosmic wheel
a lover of acceleration
no mercy or brakes applied
i see dead stars collide
in her cold unflinching power slide
comets tear the skies
gushing from a shattered silence
never so alive
like the rush of cum on nymphet amines
minds desensitized
night chords rung on a ladder of violence
darkness fantasized
sleek and polished black
instrumental in stripping gods
to neuter and mute their staves
thereafter
her laughter
shalt sound aloft their future graves
chorus
heavens above
fear the gorgon eyes of a new moon rising
except no love
when she enters your golden halls
millennial the whore
riding wide astride the horns of madness
clarions forth the war
spilling the wine of her fornication
perennial the gore
filling the lines between split nations
seeping under doors
in time tides force a wider crack
mother of abominations
our lady overkill
smothering the congregation
licks the royal milk
the scourge hangs at her girdle
death slathers near her heel
seeking blood to curdle
when the gathered clouds reveal
her roared abortive labour
thighs slick with molten steel
dripping into sabres
for vulcan spawn to wield
instrumental in stripping gods
to neuter and lash her slaves
thereafter
her laughter
shalt sound aloft the crashing waves
chorus
comets tear the skies
gushing from a shattered silence
never so alive
like the rush of cum on nymphet amines
minds desensitized
night chords rung on a ladder of violence
darkness fantasized
sleek and polished black
instrumental in stripping gods
to neuter and mute their staves
thereafter
her laughter
shalt sound aloft their future graves
chorus
mother of abominations
our lady overkill

instrumental in stripping gods

thereafter
her laughter
shalt sound aloft the crashing waves
chorus
her bouquets are wilted
too long has she slept
their cruel red mouths darkened
to bowed silhouettes
i saw in a new moon
with her scent on my breath
but then all to soon
came the hunger for flesh
i held her in eyes like necropoli
laying her on a tomb with a view
lighting her from her feet
to the stars in her hair
drove sweet blood to her throat
and my lips parted there
in the tone of splintered bone
she screams benighted
my limbs ignite
a carneal carnivore
on all fours to go...
an ebon nemesis
from torture gardens of dis
having never breathed an eve
as far narcotic as this
two spellbound hellhounds
hearts pounding loud
racing heaven out of focus
under quicksilver clouds
"god is maimed come let us prey..."
to lunar deities that pave deadways
twixt the living and the grave
amor e morte
to cast our fearl shadows there
we made love bleed on a deathbed shared
where, begging me to feed
to best be were...
i licked her wounds and ate her rare
argentinum spurred
her watnon words incurred
a sin ridden tongue
to open trading in fur
never were those gates of pearl
so rubbed to their cusp
never were the worlds above
so bitten with the bestial...
seraphim fell like guillotines
giving gracious head
instead of harking prophecies
and how our brother sang
amor e morte
in the thick evergreens
theirs was a chorus for raucous souls
shifting shape and lifting napes
to commemorate
erotic stains
amor e morte
unfasten thy masque
come skyclad to my arms
leave thy gown a dark pool at thy feet
i yearn musky valleys that no man hath seen
the chill keen of stars
over yew and deep wooded ravines
a hidden meridian
where midian may be...
in black antlered glades
encunted in this forest goddess
she whispers my name
i buck under flames
animal nitrates
howling through my veins
i ride riptides that wrest and writhe to the fore
new lusts ecllipsing lips
that brought me to this verge of war
with inner beasts unleashed
to feast, fuck and run
rampart in chase of she wolf pacts
forged on heat with setting suns
i love the night
it would murder my soul
should i ever fall blind
for though thy flesh haunts
i keep also in mind
the stampede of clouds
from dusk's predatory sky
purple versed like the funeral hearse
that first turned thee over to my...
unbridled kiss when i found thee in mist
dressed for the sepulchre
my demon bride...
"god is maimed come let us prey..."
to lunar deities that pave deadways
twixt the living and the grave
amor e morte
ours was a chorus for raucous souls
shifting sape and lifting nape
to commemorate
erotic stains
amor e morte
amor e morte
thrill, kill the black cult
walk among the weak by night
affliction...
deep as any burial
take their worthless lives...
the moon, she hangs like a cruel portrait
soft winds whisper the bidding of trees
as this tragedy starts with a shattered glass heart
and the midnightmare trampling of dreams
but no, no tears please
fear and pain may accompany death
but it is desire that shepherds it's certainty
as we shall see
she was divinity's creature
that kissed in cold mirrors
a queen of snow
far beyond compare
lips attuned to symmetry
sought her everywhere
dark liquored eyes
an arabian nightmare
she shone on watercolors
of my pond life as pearl
until those who couldn't have her
cut her free of this world
that fateful eve when
the trees stank of sunset and camphor
their lanterns chased phantoms and threw
an inquisitive glance, like the shadows they cast
on my love picking rue by the light of the moon
putting reason to flight
or to death as their way
they crept through woods mesmerized
by the taffeta ley
of her hips that held sway
over all they surveyed
save a mist on the rise
a deadly blessing to hide
her ghost in the fog
they raped left
five men of god
her ghost in the fog
dawn discovered her there
beneath the cedar's stare
silk dress torn, her raven hair
flown to gown her beauty bared
was starred with frost, i knew her lost
i wept 'til tears crept back to prayer
she'd sworn me vows in fragrant blood
"never to part
lest jealous heaven stole our hearts"
then this i screamed:
"come back to me
i was born in love with thee
so why should fate stand in between?"
and as i drowned her gentle curves
with dreams unsaid and final words
i espied a gleam trodden to earth
the church bell tower key...
the village mourned her by the by
for she'd been a witch
their men had longed to try
and i broke under christ seeking guilty signs
my tortured soul on ice
a queen of snow
far beyond compare
lips attuned to symmetry
sought her everywhere
trappistine eyes
an arabian nightmare
she was ersulie possessed
of a milky white skin
my porcelain yin
a graceful angel of sin
and so for her
the breeze stank of sunset and camphor
my lantern chased her phantom and blew
their chapel ablaze and all locked in to a pain
best reserved for judgment that their bible construed
putting reason to flight
or to flame unashamed
i swept form cries
mesmerized
by the taffeta ley
or her hips that held sway
over all those at bay
save a mist on the rise
a final blessing to hide
her ghost in the fog
and i embraced
where lovers rot
her ghost in the fog
her ghost in the fog
"you stand before this court, accused of heresy and witch craft. how do you plead?"
"not guilty!"
"guilty!"
our tongues they could not silence with their malicious lies
their unforgotten violence, remember those who died
and as my flesh is put to fire i hear their voices still
their unjust accusations demanding that i am killed
"we shall show no mercy to heathen such as thee
who stand accused and have refused the church's clemency
your wicked acts are endless through the crimes we cannot name
innocent or guilty proved, we'll burn you just the same"
burning, into the fire
burning, a funeral pyre
burning, into the fire
burning, a funeral pyre
this selfrighteous inquisition is a plague upon our land
as false as the confessions they force from shattered hands
"we shall show no mercy to heathen such as thee
who stand accused and have refused the church's clemency
your wicked acts are endless through the crimes we cannot name
innocent or guilty proved, we'll burn you just the same"
burning, into the fire
burning, a funeral pyre
burning, into the fire
burning, a funeral pyre
abused my broken body is cleansed by righteous flame,
their god a 'god of mercy' yet in whose name i slain.
my innocence the victim of their superstitious fears
religious persecution for the past three hundred years
preaching peace and mercy 'neath the shadow of the knife
a papal reign of terror, slaughter in the name of christ
and as my flesh is put to fire i hear their voices still
their unjust accusations demanding that i am killed
"we shall show no mercy to heathen such as thee
who stand accused and have refused the church's clemency
your wicked acts are endless through the crimes we cannot name
innocent or guilty proved, we'll burn you just the same"
burning, into the fire
burning, a funeral pyre
burning, into the fire
burning, a funeral pyre
sunset, expect
this to be your last with our vast return
as death is set
at three sixes where hillbeacons burn
darkness, undress
your descending skirts yield a thirsting altar
bloodred, yet still unfed
lips distend ending, time to falter
welcome arms wide and crucified
the slaughter
lightening freezes seven
outtakes from the rape of the world
sins expelled from heaven
now befoul from the bowels of hell
where the tragic in theory and practice fell
last prayers, hang in the air
each unto their own rag and bone meal saviors
strung where crippled vultures dare
golgotha
coughs another cross to grave god's failure
once the forests spired
nurtured in nature'heart
now dreat cedars feed the pyres
needfires lit for greater harm
as her children toy with razors
sightless and deeply scarred
and the moon arose to phase her
cracks a grin so wide it hides the stars
and lights our path
back through the shattered glass
we come like drumming thunder
tides enwreathed in scum and plunder
krakenteethed to tear asunder
all those too blind to see
where the tragic in theory and practice meet
deranged, uncaged
we rage like a plague through this age of greed
sowers of discord, growing wars to reap
a terrible crop to beat a vicious retreat
scorched earth, rebirth
disinterred in the writhe of the lone survivor
whose worth is worse than the curse
of sardonicus choking on his own saliva
who shares the last laugh now
dead wedded fates fulfill their vows?
foot in mouth of sacred cows
face down in dust and poisoned ground
mr. crowley, what went down in your head?
oh, mr. crowley, did you talk with the dead?
your life style to me seemed so tragic
with the thrill of it all
you fooled all the people with magic
yeah you waited on satan's call
mr. charming, did you think you were pure?
mr. alarming, in nocturnal rapport
uncovering things that were sacred
manifest on this earth
conceived in the eye of a secret
and they scattered the afterbirth
go
mr. crowley, won't you ride my white horse?
oh, mr. crowley, it's symbolic of course
approaching a time that is classic
i hear the maidens call
approaching a time that is drastic
standing with their backs to the wall
was it polemically sent?
i want to know what you meant
i want to know
i want to know what you meant
go.
sister midnight comes blaspheming
screaming in the keys of faith and fear
unentwining, our spines twists me to kneeling
spilling like the moonlight on her glistening rear
defiled at heart in this perfect hell
under red leaves bleeding over scaled chateau we fell
to demonocracy, where neither adam or eve
conceived of such iniquities from pleasure or pain
or the razor's edge in between
thou art my seventh heaven burning
going down as with the sun
within like a river fluids moves a torrent
bound to please on denierred knees
in any wicked way that her whims may warrant
i hang on every verb, every dirty word, interred
in her pornoglossa, christlike, whipped and weak
painted nails driven through the meek
yet in obituary, my dreams still weep
of dark blood and fucking thee
thou art my seventh heaven burning
going down as with the day
baring lunar curvature like canvas for a lick of pain
writhing like a viper deep inside her eden
forbidden to eat, i kiss leylines to her feet
then baiting wrath, i steal a path
back to the fruits of her womb
back to the crack of her tomb
her roseate sliver quivers with snuff appeal
the torque of her hips, lipsync me in for the kill
tonguetied, tightrope and spread like disease
i drain the cup of this miss sire, her water into wine for me
thou art my seventh angel squirming
'neath the forked tongue of the beast
arching toward the fabled
like a sculptured nymph seeking base relief
whilst the world outside
a wood of suicide
would die for this release
our slow orgasmic fuses greet
by night and by candle at each other's throat
in a slick drift of red, setting god's teeth on edge
we were as wolves preying inside the fold
of a slaughtered lamb throw on a four poster bed
succulent, succubus
laid without rest in the dead of the night
succulent, succubus
in thy arms and thy wetness
on glossed lips i taste
conspiracies, secrecies, sorceries laced
with thick unguent rum, blackrayed suns and autumn
always in season for our nightfall from grace
gorge upon my seed
starved persephone
succulent, succubus
that i might keep
thee with me in hades
succulent, succubus
succour me
succulent, succubus
succour me
succulent, succubus
succulent, succubus
incomprehensible
tonight is the night
the empowering wind that draws breath from despite
roars ??neath my wings as i soar with the end in sight
choirs ignite
a swansong for leda
deathknells for troy
tragedy blooms from one act
i am nemesis
poured in my arms
when my daughter's eyelids closed
i swore to slaughter those
who stole my ray of moonlight
so strike up the skies
the diction of thunder
godgiven rites
no fiction can deafen the fact
i am nemesis
cowled in the utter grief
i am the priest of a new disorder
whose flag unfurled
bears a hatred for the western world
the is no compromise
no piped lament
to stay the blind
just a shrike cacophony of war
ashes ember, fires rise
no longer am i paralyzed
now i drown in a loss worth fighting for
black is my heart
black is my heart
black is my heart
i am nemesis
black is my heart
black is my heart
black is my heart
i am nemesis
nemesis
nemesis
tonight is the night
the city sweats fever, the filth in her womb
shifts like the season's unease at the hands of doom
restless inside
her split underbelly
suitored with flies
martial bowels now contract
i am nemesis
poured in my arms
when my daughter's eyelids closed
i swore to slaughter those
who stole my ray of moonlight
never again
our enemies entertained
i toy at the clasp of her chain
and remember the fight
cowled in utter grief
i am the priest of a new disorder
whose flag unfurled
bears a hatred for the western world
there is no compromise
no piped lament to stay the blind

take away the wine
for restlessness plagues me...
i am assailed by a spectre profounder
than hatred and grief or the sum of their hideous crime
i shalt suffer this confessional mime
awaiting the sun to set, crimsoning seas
only once it is dark doth my misery cease
she died to a sky dressed in flame
eyes full of curses for her killers by choice
who fell to their god o'er her vision and voice
glory and praise to thee in all the steeps
of heaven where thou didst reign, and in the deeps
of hell where fallen thy dream, silently.

pour submission into me
no church shall bar our paths
seductive evil drink...
your fill of the bleeding christ in your arms
where scorn is fed in the blackest fucking soul!
your misery is worn as a veil
to hide bewitchment of the ugliest kind
in place of eve a bitter parody hails
daggers from the swagger
of a sodomite's concubine

gilded cunt
oh, you gilded cunt
your thin pretence overstretched and sickly
feigns love and light a long time laid in the grave
my preference leans to killing you quickly
scissored in the gizzard
that a heart no more maintains
but i am tied
to the labyrinth and the beast
the oneway track of eyes
black and grey like panzers
loose your shell
shoot the mouth
the gates of hell
have often dropped their jaws about
satan's agents were perversion to bear
side to side with their diversions
you use to guide my fingers there

nothing is above you save a boreal light
that halo paid for by a consummated ring of ice
and below you, will i see you tonight
glower from your tower
built of ivory and spite?
for i am torn
between the sheets that keep me borne
and the teeth of a storm
they reap then rape my stanzas
click your heels
three times six
the stars are fixed
may i climb and get you one?
the palace at versailles never held your tongue
nor did heaven ever weather
the crosses that you came upon

spells lay daggers before me
passion speaks in grue vehement stabs
trance my eyes, fix my focus to pain
the tumor grows until the enemy is slain
slightless storm
kneedeep in hate, i seethe
my purpose here has woken to breath
total war on the brethren of men
millions regardless, dying by my hand
a black age of fire
brief in its vicious eloquence
removing the dross
love will arise from the ashes of your loss
then and only then
will the pleasure of eden be mine
and the sinews of life itself will be tied
in the very veins of my bloodline
and their tears tasted sweet
i will rule as a king
and the goddess will sit
as my guiding queen
in the glory of the earth
our crowns are studded
with the jewels of blasphemy
blasphemy
slightless storm
kneedeep in hate, i seethe
my purpose here has woken to breath
total war on the brethren of men
millions regardless, dying by my hand
your blood is the life
your blood is the life
i seek to evoke a new order in man
a flood of compulsion to resurrect khem
the lion is vexed to uproot and descend
chaos my steed in the thick, clinging dust
tempering weapons of criminal lust
i hold sway from the east to fulfill prophecies
thinning the cause as fresh cells to disease
your blood is the life
your blood is the life
even the moon, will not lend thee her light
the darkness serves will to snuff out human life
that i might reclaim the world as my right
i kill without scruple or silent regret
in haunts of the sinister lunar aspect
for i am the pleasure that comes from your pain
tiny red miracles falling like rain
the incessant walls of death surrounds me
but this is not the part of me that wishes to breed
there will be no dread thereafter
the mysteries, i reveal unto thee
i stir the hearts of the wisest
by the fools, i will always be feared
my kingdom feeds off their slaughter
a crescendo of passion bleeding
on the pale reflection of dawn
devour the sun
instrumental
i bled on a pivotal stretch
like a clockwork christ
bears sore stigmata, bored
and as i threw job, i drove
myself to a martyred wretch
to see if i drew pity
or pretty litanies from the lord
so the plot sickened
with the coming of days
ill millennia thickened
with the claret i sprayed
and though they saw red
i left a dirty white stain
a splintered know in the grain
on eden's marital aid
so glad for the madness
i walked the walls, naked to the moon
in sodom and babylon
and through rich whores and corridors
of the vatican, i led a sordid borgia on
i read the urilia text
so that mortals wormed
as live bait for the dead
and as i broke hope, i choked
another pope with manna peel
dictating to de sade
in the dark entrails of the bastille
and as he wrote, i smote
a royal blow to the heads of france
and in the sheen of guillotines
i saw others, fallen, dance
i was an incurable
necromantic old fool
a phagadaena that crawled
drooling over the past
a rabid wolf in shawl
a razor's edge to the rule
that the stars overall
were never destined to last
so glad for the madness
i furnaced dreams, a poet, for of sleep
turning sermons with the smell
on witchfinder fingers
where bad memories lingered
burning, as when dante was freed to map hell
i sired schemes and the means
to catch sight of the seams
and the vagaries in between
and midst the lips and the curls
of this cunt of a world
in glimpses, i would see
a nymph with eyes for me
eyes of fire that set all life aflame
lights that surpassed art
in sight, that no intense device of pain
could prise their secrets from my heart
i knew not her name
though her kiss was the same
without a whisper of shame
as either virtue or sin's
and pressed to her curve
i felt my destiny swerve
from damnation reserved
to a permanent grin
so glad for the madness
instrumental
spawned wanton like blight on an auspicious night
her eyes betrayed spells of the moon's eerie light
a disquieting gaze forever ghosting far seas
bled white and dead, her true mother was fed
to the ravenous wolves that the elements led
from cragjagged mountains that seemingly grew in unease
through the maw of the woods, a black carriage was drawn
flanked by barbed lightning that hissed of the storm
gilded in crests of carpathian breed
bringing slaves to the sodomite for the newborn
on that eve when the countess' own came deformed
a tragedy crept to the name bathory
elizabeth christened, no paler a rose
grew so dark as this sylph
none more cold in repose
yet her beauty spun webs
round hearts a glance would betroth
she feared the light
so when she fell like a sinner to vice
under austere, puritanical rule
she sacrificed
mandragora like virgins to rats in the wall
but after whipangels licked prisoners, thralled
never were her dreams so maniacally cruel
and possessed of such delights
for ravens winged her nightly flights
of erotica
half spurned from the pulpit
torments to occur
half learnt from the cabal of demons
in her
her walk went to voodoo
to see her own shadow adored
at mass without flaw
though inwards she abhored
not her coven of suitors
but the stare of their lord
"i must avert mine eyes to hymns
for his gaze brings dogmas to my skin
he knows that i dreamt of carnal rites
with him undead for three long nights"
elizabeth listened
no sermons intoned
dragged such guilt to her door
tombed her soul with such stone
for she swore the priest sighed
when she knelt down to atone
she feared the light
so when she fell
like a sinner to vice
under austere, puritanical rule
she sacrificed
her decorum as chaste
to this wolf of the cloth
pouncing to haunt
her confessional box
forgiveness would come
when her sins were washed off
by rebaptism in white
the looking glass cast belladonna wreaths
'pon the grave of her innocence
her hidden face spat murder
from a whisper to a scream
all sleep seemed cursed
in faustian verse
but there in orgiastic hell
no horrors were worse
than the mirrored revelation
the she kissed the devil's phallus
by her own decree
so with windows flung wide to the menstrual sky
solstice eve she fled the castle in secret
a daughter of the storm, astride her favourite nightmare
on winds without prayer
stigmata still wept between her legs
a cold bloodedness which impressed new hatreds
she sought the sorceress
through the snow and dank woods to the sodomite's lair
nine twisted fates threw hewn bone die
for the throat of elizabeth
damnation won and urged the moon
in soliloquy to gleam
twixt the trees in shafts
to ghost a path
past the howl of buggered nymphs
in the sodomite's grasp
to the forest's vulva
where the witch scholared her
in even darker themes
"amongst philtres and melissas
midst the grease of strangled men
and eldritch truths, elder illomen
elizabeth came to life again"
and under lacerations of dawn she returned
like a flame unto a deathshead
with a promise to burn
secrets brooded as she rode
through mist and marsh to where they showed
her castle walls wherein the restless
counted carrion crows
she awoke from a fable to mourning
church bells wringing her madly from sleep
tolled by a priest, self castrated and hung
like a crimson bat 'neath the belfry
the biblical prattled their mantras
hexes sixtripled their fees
but elizabeth laughed, thirteen autumns had passed
and she was a widow from god and his wrath, finally
nightfall, in thrall
i call her beauty to me
whose ebonlidded eyes excite
shadows to wander through me
whose kiss glittered with sleep
is a thief come after dark
to steal away the leaden wreaths
from my cemetery heart
thrilled to see the light
bruisereddened, silhouetting
murder sites
as dusk attends her son's blood wedding
spilt across the skies
in reefs of omen
licking flames and pagan rites
the night awaits with baited thighs
start this artist darkness
yearning now to start this
burning as an artist
turning on the darkness
dizzy looking up with pervertigo
a sewer deity of recrement
world below
i'll make you pray
i spy with wicked lips
the cream of mortal kind
committing their sins
their penitent skins
to the harems of my mind
prey
thrilled to breathe tonight
the sultry air of graces
passed in flight
like birds of may with playful faces
fills me with delight
their crystal skirts
spun from stars, worn tight
wink of fists in wishful places
start this artist darkness
yearning now to start this
burning as an artist
turning on the darkness
dizzy looking up with pervertigo
a sewer deity of recrement
world below
i'll make you pray
my whims like smoke in summertime
writhe atop the blooms
committing their thin
white catholic limbs
to the cloister in my room
you see i need
to feed my dreams to order
to be agreed
with the beast in me
that bleeds their borders
prey
nightfall, in thrall
i call her beauty to me
whose ebonlidded eyes excite
shadows to wander through me
whose kiss glittered with sleep

incomprehensible
she is open wide, she isn't hard to please
she drives me fucking wild i want her on her knees
she floats and insists i am hot and can't resist
she sucks me to the core, oh i can't take no more
that bitch
she turns me to a beast
bestial lust, come on bitch
each tendon, muscle rippling she drink my incomprehensible with greed
she fuck like every body and she just raise the speed
she let her wet tongue roll i gasp and can't control
she is hot and drives me wild and still she is open wide
just when this torture seems to end
she is there to drain my soul again
come on ride, ride on me bitch
bestial lust
instrumental
behind the scene of destiny
i adore you in this song for me
call me within your holy house to dwell
let me raise for myself in spell
voluptuously dancing daughters of the night sky
sing the rapturous love song with high
let your sweet scented juice run
waste away under the lashes of my whip
bath in sin, sadistic souls
break their crust, sodomy and lust
carnal desire runs through my veins
whipping boys and scapegoats cry in pain
psychopathic terror during their sleep
my power ask why, my power is weak
spineless bundles of my excess
expurse of innocence and helplessness
in the perfumes of my secret orison
fresh blood of children drops down on me
bath in sin, sadistic souls
break their crust, sodomy and lust
madness, crime, disgrace, ptomaine
excrements, contempt, violence, kill
ordeals of thousand deeds congealed in gloom
strike hard and deep, to hell with 'em master
mighty prophets stature shall surpass the stars
the passion is the smell of cremation
i spit on your crapulous creed, curse 'em
sucking you giveth delight and bright glory
strive ever to be more joyous to the death
don't fear any god will deny you for this
bath in sin, sadistic souls
break their crust, sodomy and lust
"mirror, mirror on the wall
shouldst not grave pleasures be my all?
for if i shall see thy will be done
grant me the witchcraft of thy tongue"
three moondials froze in the shadow of six
as another soul passed to the grasping styx
clutching their trinket crucifix
bats blew from eaves in a dissonant surge
omens of corruption from within the church
a fetid, dank oasis still clung to fool rebirth
alone as a stone cold altar
the castle and its keep
like faerytale dominion rose
a widow to the snow peaks
wherein reclined the countess
limbs purring from the kill
bathed in virgin white and like the night
alive and young and unfulfilled
was it the cry of a wolf
that broke the silver thread of enchanted thoughts?
of her life as a mere reflection
as the moon's in narrow windows caught
that opened like dark eyelids on
the sigh of the woods that the wind fell upon
like a siren weaving song
from the lilt of choirs choking
where the vengeful dead
belong...
to the sorceress and her charnel arts
she swept from ebon towers at the hour of mars
'neath a starinwoven sky latticed by scars
to unbind knotted reins that kept in canter, despair
shod on melancholy, fleet to sanctuary there,
in netherglades tethered where onyx idols stared
was it the kiss of the mist
that peopled the air with the prowess of absinthe?
lost souls begging resurrection
from gods upon their forest plinths
whose epitaphs read of reascending to win
remission from despair through a holocaust of sin
in a tongue hilted in invective rectums
over signs and seals the sorceress prayed
to death, to rend the slender veil
that ancient ones might rise again
as shadows swelled
the countess fell
to masturbating with her dagger
as the witch gabbled spells
cumming heavy roses all the way to hell
as sudden thunder's grue harangue
announced two pincered worlds
exuding bane, something came
with the stench of necrophiled graves
to these clandestines
who shrank from glimpsing horror
that the growls of mating houls inclined...
resplendent
in pendants
natal trophies torn from bellies of desanctified nuns
a demons, bewinged, bedight
in scum, prowled their circle seeking entry to run
an arctic tongue upon her vulva
where rubies smeared to alabaster thighs
glittered like a contract in the purse of a whore
receiving sole communion from the body of christ
"if blood is what thou carves, foul fiend
i will yield this witch to thee
if thou wouldst draw a veil for me
o'er lengthening scars of age and grief"
as the demon slavered foetid vows
and bore his prey away
in talons itching to perpetrate
the nausea of eternal rape
the sorceress screaming in his grasp
spat a final curse to stain
the countess with the promise
that her lord at war would be cruelly slain
and she would rot.
alone
insane.

flowers lift your precious head to me
i have come to her warm embrace
the gentle touch of surreality
a sweet kiss from beloved faith
the gardens swim with fervent life tonight
i sense the beauty that waits for me there
dancing with the statues in the pale moonlight
the velveret whisper at play with her hair
the time has come
to rise again
freedom lift thy sewered hem
free from beasts and skewered men
my dreams unroll
ten thousand fold
their world will never take me
they will never desecrate my soul
the stars i have grasped
are so far lonely constellations
and wishing on those stars
my spirit bars annihilation
from earthen miseries
hosts of most fell forms of greed
ghosts of pearly gate remissions
forever haunting me
slit the witch and watch him bleed
as with any inquisition
lying from the start
the preachers piled their craft
scoffing elder glories
and dying, i depart
to make their sunken hearts
a coffin for their stories
the time is past
the falter when
freedom slips my sombre pen
and the gates to wolves break open then
my feelings may
seem constant prey
but claws no more will rake me
those whores have fled to darker days
above and beyond
i have wronged in my position
but now the winds are strong
to soar from babel's vision
of cutthroat jealousies
dock to dock these mongrels breed
dogs of fogged derision
pacing, soon to be
back to pack mentality
when my killing moon is risen
trying from the start
these creatures of the dark
were quaffing morning glories
and dying, i depart
to make their drunken hearts
a coffin for their stories
innovation in ovation
imagination stirs
somewhere the dusk is lining
red the shore of a roaring sea
and though loved there is someone pining
for the waves of blood to run and rescue me?
the time has come
to rise again
freedom lift thy sewered hem
free from beasts and skewered men
my dreams unroll
ten thousand fold
their world will never take me
they will never desecrate my soul
their world will never break me
they will never desecrate my soul

have you run your fingers down the wall
and have you felt your neck skin crawl
when you're searching for the light?
sometimes when you're scared to take a look
at the corner of the room
you've sensed that some thing's watching you
fear of the dark, fear of the dark
i have constant fear that some thing's always near
fear of the dark, fear of the dark
i have a phobia that someone's always there
have you ever been alone at night
thought you heard footsteps behind
and turned around and no one's there?
and as you quicken up your pace
you find it hard to look again
because you're sure there's someone there
fear of the dark, fear of the dark
i have constant fear that some thing's always near
fear of the dark, fear of the dark
i have a phobia that someone's always there
watching horror films the night before
debating witches and folklores
the unknown troubles on your mind
maybe your mind is playing tricks
you sense, and suddenly eyes fix
on dancing shadows from behind
fear of the dark, fear of the dark
i have constant fear that some thing's always near
fear of the dark, fear of the dark
i have a phobia that someone's always there
fear of the dark, fear of the dark

rise, ablaze, libidinous
devildom voyeurs
ascend to smother the light
nascent aeons confer
chaos is spat
from the black eternal sea
serrated mountains of mad shadows
carving towards misdeed
stormchoirs gather
a pestilential hiss
sunset evokes luciferian fire
the skies are ruptured like a knifed orifice
supernal vestments hang tattered
cathedrals shriek to pulpit oratory
invasions scale babel's ivory towers
poised to sodomise a world upon it's knees
victory spent
breathe deep benighted scent
we are as a flame born unto the darkness
desires burning in palatial glades
and virtues once aloof, now worming beneath us
shalt see their children, pleasuring as slaves
attack!
wreak atrocities on those we have despised
judgements be riven, from the skies
darkness empower let us master prophecy
fulfilling destiny the promised fever
bedizens eyes paralysed with blasphemy
written in flesh across the howling ether
artemis
spread the bliss of this lupercalia
with stars erased, throw wide the gates
the infidel soon unmasks her face
neath silken shroud she waxes horn
sharpened to skewer dawn
i am as a plague, born to the priestess
the secret amour of her archangelic rape
jadedeyed when my lovers, possessed
screamed out their agonies, upon the stake
"the most august sorcerers of hades
darkly seized for me a throne
and the upraised scythe so terribly scribed
vengeance in jesuit blood on stone
from this ransacked celestial temple
i hold the prophet's severed head unto all nations"
tremble before us
lords of the starveiled red sepulchres
rushing deathwards, our tartarean fires
kindle pandemonia to furnace the earth
"our voices are opened graves
through which the neverdead escape"
from dank, abyssic dream
pursuing ascendancy
the enemy has held three seasons
imparadised, whilst we writhed
to psychodramas penned by aerial decree
now freed to plunder
heaven torn asunder
take away the wine
for restlessness plagues me
i am assailed by a spectre profounder
than hatred and grief or the sum of their hideous crime
i shalt suffer this confessional mime
awaiting the sun to set, crimsoning seas
only once it is dark doth my misery cease
she died to a sky dressed in flame
eyes full of curses for her killers by choice
who fell to their god o'er her vision and voice
"i am as dusk come to ravish the light"
steal me from their stares and mute christ into night
"i will answer thy prayers"
if thou wouldst drink of my life
encroaching evening skies
die with such tragedy
and those interred in cold graves
dwell on pleasures to be
in deep hysteria
where our legend still breathes
through sweet death and thereafter
sweeping nightmares shalt feed
an archangel in bondage
bediademed, souled
with a murder of ravens
but no less astarte to behold
abandoned by heaven
to the dead, dark and past
cast her dispersions
on life's brittle glass
and though her eyes still held fire
as stonewalls caged the beast
'gainst the lassitudes of death
she fought but fell to greet
and midst lies in collusion
she was martyred to teach
that divinity and lust
are forever forbidden to meet
but i swore that they would
before the veil could part our embrace
twixt her cold, silent hips, i kissed
and promised christendom in flames
gravid with madness
like a feculent dirge
that obsesses the heart
i am convened by words
to avenge her ebon splendor and surrender
my soul to the dead to achieve
prophecies of libidinous scourge
horripilation braying over carious herds
vexing nightmares
and their weak prayers
to a no one there
to hinder her decree
to weed the world of their disease
as shadows unblind mine eyes to see
the meat that is their congregation
how they plead to the skies
but this is mere foreplay to war
scarriddled saffron eves bleed like the conjugal
vestal daughters giving throat to the priest
a psychophant, the despoiler of faith
now his skinless crucifixion feeds a winged diocese
for her interred
i tore a battle banner from his hide
splashed in red goetia
hues of hell and deicide
so came the night
its obsidian light
is a master whom disasters
suck upon like concubines
and under black skirts
that whisper of delight
dark seeds near fruition
darked deeds to marry mine
in death's bed, i have lain
paying lipservice to shame
but for dreaming of thee, i regain
a reason to seek life again
then we smite the divine
for our true nature is sin
to strip tender flesh from these swine
like the lick of carnivorous winds
the breath of the storm that begins
by forcing its herod tongue in
the womb of the holy virgin
to taste of immaculate sin
from temptation's peak, we will see
the world unfurled at last
now the wolves of time who stalk mankind
shall be as one in grim repast
commemorating sickle moons
the pack are poised to reap
a scythe of white roses in bloom
whose twisted thorns will keep
a crown upon a dead man
daylights crucified in sleep
and lives that hide in scriptured lies
to the memories of a scream
and we shall dance amid the ruin
as adam and evil
dizzy at the falling stars
that burn fiercer in throes of upheaval
if all must we damn for this moment
then it shall be so
for our souls have crossed oceans of time
to clasp one another more tightly
than death could alone
as zyklon beats reign to make carrion crawl
the talons of lust rake a clarion call
to the lick of carnivorous winds
to the lick of carnivorous winds
gravid with madness
like a feculent dirge
that obsesses the heart
i am convened by words
to avenge her ebon splendor and surrender
my soul to the dead to achieve
prophecies of libidinous scourge
horripilation braying over carious herds
vexing nightmares
and their weak prayers
to a no one there
to hinder her decree
to weed the world of their disease
as shadows unblind mine eyes to see
the meat that is their congregation
incomprehensible
the feast of fools, 1308
as january slipped into the grip of winter
a leather leash tightened round the throat of fate
amidst the flock, disease and dementia
night was blighted more than ever before
with screams of lust and obscene adventure
and scenes of raw debauch
the darkness was aroused with every kiss
and all who fell under it's spell
were one foul step from the abyss
one foul step from the abyss
sacred village there in all hallows fair
feared the templars and their queen
for lilith compared to a royal nightmare
when she steered their tempestuous
feverdreams
the beast was loose and beauty party
to the horrors of this sonorous whore
a seducer, medusa
a frozen hecate cloned
stealing seed, here needs were like a cancer
growing stronger with each whimpering dog
knelt before her, thirteen necromancers
called from desert sands to this land of opportunity
the darkness was aroused with every kiss
and all who fell under its spell
were one foul step from the abyss
one foul step from the abyss
love was drugged by a copious vendor
a train of servants for here decadent games
purring on rugs in fugs of opiate splendor
vain lilith spread her wings again
stars, they gasped and comets in ovation
lit the towers, their very presence declared
they watch with lust, despair and veneration
for the goddess scatted naked there
the painted eye of the storm
plagues of sin, played to win
all hearts and souls in thrall
to her embraced, her fatal whims
desire meant to conquer all
until that fateful day, 1308
with a force blessed by the kings of hate
facing winter gray to disintegrate
once noble halls
the villagers in a belligerent horde
fraught daughters fanning flames
rose like pillars for their militant lord
thoughts of slaughter haranguing hot veins
they assailed the fort beyond the woods
as the howling broke on the stroke of midnight
many lost their sanity at what they fought
amidst those walls, creed of dementia
annihilated by sheer weight of the surge
put to the sword, freed from their calenture
the great estate was given straight to the church
of lilith, no limb ranked amongst the dead
but that she drank the blood of many men
that dark night it was said
church bells resounded like judgment day
as they were making love
in the rainswept graveyard
she fucked him hard, silhouetted by flame
a monsoon tigress set upon prey
fall for the love of me
crawl for the love of me
drool for the love of my virulent sway
i grow more master the faster the days
lilith immaculate
this delectable reaper
her eyes were profound
drawing him in deeper
until he was drowned
hurled on the shore
of the world underground
lilith immaculate
mortal kind, a morbid wine
for this dark moon goddess
and freed to stretch her claws
this beautiful whore
would be brutally honest
tortuous one, taboos undone
a glittering star on a sea of myriad waves
and a thickening mist, a seductress
leading lovesick hearts astray
lilith
in the throes of orgasm, she bucked and he broke
at the height of the storm, the chaos they'd smote
burning behind her in arabesque smoke
framed a vision transformed as she sucked from his throat
victoria smiled, her now golden eyes
possessed a regal bearing
of omnipotent power
from wet lips to her smoldering thighs
her beauty perfected and her will agonized
fall for the love of me
crawl for the love of me
drool for the love of my virulent sway
i grow more the master the faster the days
lilith immaculate
with dread single purpose
her mind told him stay
she strode through the fire
desire aflame
she murdered the nuns
in such horrible ways
lilith immaculate
"that night we lay entwined on hay
inside a soldier's barn
her panting breath an opiate
as in her bolder grasp
i caught the scent of desert sands
the holy lands, the fall of reason
but only when i smelt the blood
did i fear her colder hand"
"i am darkness, i am sin
the queen of lust invited in
reborn at last to cast my
fecund shadow on this world,
you shall worship me, enslaved
for many lovers shall i crave
and in return, i'll gladly pave
your psycho path with pearls
for i have been grating
and waiting so long to find
the most perfect hostess close to me
whose thinice troubled mind
was like a cracked, black ornate mirror
to slip right through in time
when at last i wore harmonia's necklace
the cursed twin serpents mine"
tortuous one, debauchery won
the attention of emperors, princes and tsars
for the toll of her kiss, no soul could dismiss
the advance of her throne from afar
this english rose with traits of those
who graced the harems of the east
adorned with thorns, she raised the horns
and scarlet hems to wasted priests
fall for the love of me
crawl for the love of me
drool for the love of my virulent sway
i grow more master the faster the days
lilith immaculate
this delectable reaper
her eyes were profound
they drew him in deeper
until he was drowned
hurled on the shore
of the world underground
lilith immaculate
fall for the love of me
crawl for the love of me
drool for the love of my virulent sway
i grow more master the faster the days
lilith immaculate
the flutes and sweet wine
of her voice anodyne
her power was growing
every hour malign
the truth, lilith's kingdom
drew closer with time
i am she
lilith
mistress of the dark
of sheba
first offender
and succor to demons
whose sweet seductions and wicked rites
lead all too enslaved by the flesh
to trespass against god's holy law
and tonight i come for you
midnight strikes, the candles sputter
muttering their recking spells
i snuff their tongues, my heart aflutter
these words i speak are gates to hell
casus belli
in hoc signo vinces
veritas vos liberabit
casus belli
in hoc signo vinces
in aeternum, amen
the scent of death is rent
in this ornamental verse
in ventures down the centuries
tormenting me with secrets so anathema
and now the fires grate
i must relate, to end this curse
i'll break through spires to escape my fate
am i too late or just perverse?
midnight strikes, the candles sputter
muttering their recking spells
i snuff their tongues, my heart aflutter
these words i speak are gates to hell
so the blight begins
near the woodland of a frightened village
where the rites of unimaginable sin
and the howling on the wind
chills the blood for fear of spillage
where nightfall used to be
blessed with best tranquility
its no caressed by misadventure
templars from the crusades
have birthed a church, more masquerade
in which they worship mass dementia
they came from dust and flame
by the red sea on dead shores
fleeing claims of blasphemy
and bestiality
devils fed them back to us
knights of holy wars, inviting hordes
of grim infidelities
in the grip of cryptic lands
and desert sands
they found just cause
and midst their entourage
under stars
they bought relics and parts
of saints
and evil left to clerics charge
with muslim plunder they built their sect
to the composite baphomet
an androgynous sphinx, open, erect
universal in its closet display
spawn of lilith and samael
first offender and the snake
in thrall like pawns beneath its spell
the templars grew to astute surrender
sabbatical, fanatical
they adorned its monstrous bur
whit a kings ransom of easter jewels
the embodiment of beast and lust
many moons the proved the boom
of immutable beautiful
darkness everafters
then one eve when the ancient trees
outside, drew back, unnerved
the pleas form those impatient teased
something from the black beyond of nowhere
a stunning woman, summoned
comming scimitarcurved
statuesque, but living flesh
draping nakedness about their pagan saviors
she came lilith, a perfect myth
the scarlet whore
skinned in magnificence
in her defense
she only slew a few of theme
born of a sacrifice, a virgins price
for the merging with a goddess
she prowled the world again
enslaving man
with the surging of her bodice
midnight strikes, the candles sputter
muttering their recking spells
i snuff their tongues, my heart aflutter
these words i speak are gates to hell
casus belli
in hoc signo vinces
veritas vos liberabit
casus belli
in hoc signo vinces
in aeternum, amen
on the night all mirrors fell silent
and the clocks struck accord with the rain
a storm swept in with such violence
the dead rose to complain
the stars were illcrossed as the weather
lost in its bitumen cloak
the angels were warring, slick with endeavour
falling like tears through the thickening smoke
blood redeems, heaven torn asunder
a flood of souls scream on the rolling thunder
blood redeems, heaven torn asunder
she stirs from dreams barely three feet under
"victoria, i come to claim my prize
stealing from the convent 'neath the wrath of seething skies
for though you greased the palm of satan
with those moonlit silver thighs
i knew the beast took second place
when i looked into your eyes
your deceiving eyes
filled with lies
and missed good byes
and serpents hissing revelations
your deceiving eyes
they tell enough
of how i fell in love
with the goddess creeping deep inside you"
and with the tumult up above him roaring
isaac sought her shallow grave
as lightning bolted through the grim downpouring rain
he struck the hallowed earth again
having torn at the soil like a man insane
 threw his fists at the poisonous cosmos
and from that pit of shame
he bore the coffin from her sorry lot
neath trees whose eaves were knotted with rot
through ornate chapel doors, unlocked
to splinter her sarcophagus
and gaze upon her face
victoria
"victoria, i come to claim my prize
stealing from the convent 'neath the wrath of seething skies
for though you greased the palm of satan
with those moonlit silver thighs
making mockery of rosaries
his needs will never rival mine
i recall a summer's day
the sunlight bathed your penitential scars
as i sat and washed the blood away
now your body stays
and the coldness of your lips
eclipse
like the first true kiss of winter"
pining for the dead
on the stone floor spread
she was shining through her winding shroud
a moon amid the mad, this son of adam had
a gift for the pretty young nun
a necklace wrought of twining snakes
two gold illicit tongues
he laid it at her throat
where the rope had wrung
he was burning from the furnace
of his roused desire
he wrested with temptation
to be or unfulfilled
she was undressed for ovation
her sumptuous form, the storm revealed
and with his driven lust exploding
her lashes brushed his cheeks
they flickered with life, her limbs enfolding
purring, licking wicked teeth
"victoria, i come to claim my prize
stealing from the convent neath the wrath of seething skies
for though you greased the palm of satan
with those moonlit silver thighs
you have left him just for me
i see it in deceiving eyes
those deceiving eyes
filled with lies
and missed good byes
and serpents hissing revelations
those deceiving eyes
they tell enough
of how i fell in love
with the goddess rearisen in you"
kill a man and you are a murderer
kill millions of men and you are a conqueror
kill everyone and you are a god
born of the best of enemies
beyond the pearly constellations
where in heaven has no embassy
and hope no surly grip on reason
yahweh, frankincense
satan, gold and murder
yahweh, frankincense
satan, gold and murder
he is sly, bejeweled with sylph
slick limbs spread wide
to guide you through the filth
and rust crawl to him fueled by lust
he's the horned one in the pentagram
a waste of chaos by the gram
dark eyes for trouble
double damned, despair
the storm upon lake lachrymose
restless, never comatose
the thorn upon
the single rose we share
germination
his a renegade a capella now obeyed
a shitstorm without warning
the pleasuit king in yellow on parade
son of the thunderous morning
yahweh, frankincense
satan, gold and murder
yahweh, frankincense
satan, gold and murder
he is high, inured with vice
the towercree er on our edelweiss career
a foreign power cut of utter fear
taught curiosity, he s atrocity, banned
the taste of chaos by the dram
a tortured course like slaughtered lamb
best rare
the curse that haunts this thirsting tomb
disturbed, becomes the worst of doom
rehearsing all his worth for soon, he's there
extermination
he is hatred, greed and war
he is everything we ought abhor
were it not for the fateful truth, be sure
we suffer him all the more
and lo, his tyrant's eye
is fixed upon our rich and vibrant sky
now hear the wind
herald desolation
as on that eve when angels clad
in nothing but their whispered virtues
they slipped into the valley
of the dirty serpentine
hes the horned one in the pentagram
a waste of chaos by the gram
dark eyes for trouble
double damned, despair
the storm upon lake lachrymose
restless, never comatose
the thorn upon
the single rose we share
desperation
disdainful, he selfdeprecates
the mirror's jagged stare
and it's painful how we subjugate
the grinning face reflected in there
yahweh, frankincense
satan, gold and murder
yahweh, frankincense
satan, gold and murder

the world was her cloister, the abbess duboir
in the convent at all hallows fair
a pearl in an oyster she shone like a star
augmenting her sisterhoods prayers
her singing touched angels and melted their hearts
her choirs inspired the search
for the lost holy grail, the benedict arts
and the best of the catholic church
but if one thing
one precious little thing
would darken this facade
there would be such consequences
like the night sister victoria
stepped in from the freezing cold
no candles would light at evening mass
the days passed by without a sigh
but dusk came thick with dread
intangible, the air was full
of wanderlust and approaching bloodshed
in truth, the abbess with her pious whims
enjoyed the new girl's pain
proof to the rest tat the briars of sin
entangled all the world in satan's name
victoria varco, once heiress
to a proud noble estate
fell pregnant by her recklessness
who then fell foul to a violent fate
such was here cime in expedient times
and the shame of besmirching her name
her child was burnt, she was dragged to these walls
for a life in obedient chains
but not one thing
one precious little thing
would darken this facade
like the night sister victoria
woke screaming in her room
she spent a week spiralling from heaven
and as the seasons wheezed and pained
her dream grew more perverse
for no good reasons she would to find
an alluring woman naked save for jewels and verse
when here eyelids close, on a moonlit shore
this intoxicating beauty would appear
the sweetest symphony composed
those abating lips rose
tho whisper dirty secrets in her ear
clandestine secrets
a dream within a dream
she finds herself this nymph
abreast a desert dune
and below the crescent moon
atop a darksome stranger
ah, the spurting of his seed inside here
triggers paradise
she rides the beast until the heavens trembled
forcing eclipse, her lover licks her blood
that drips upon the sand
and almost out of hand
coarse plots assemble
for somewhere in the convent walls
a templar treasure rests
forgotten to the vestibules
like pleasures of the flesh
so, in return for nightly runs
past tongues and wisdom's hiss
she promised to assist the hunt
for an ancient golden chain amiss
she slept in ecstasy
in hands that fanned her wildest fantasies
freed from christ's frigid regime
and rigid nails
she was first in church
to lick her lips and selfdebased
each waking second felt like heaven
in the scarlet one's embrace
and at last, clear memories, aghast
relinquished their control
all things held dear to the wretched past
coalesced within her soul
madness crept into her sight
though her sinful hair
spoke of nothing to the contrary
once dulled eyes leaped alive with life
her piece of broken mirror
barely recognized
the worm was turning
for her sat grinning victoria
who, no three weeks ago
was flogged red to euphoria
for her dour love of god
and the ardor of his crows
cold cloisters kept the dead apart
at the retreat of the sacred heart
she stepped in ecstasy
neath skies that plied her wildest fantasies
freed into love's reacquainted dream
and sudden gales
night grew sultry late september
a man came from the village
through the woods
to help with harvest
she was burning like the fields
all her vows lay unfulfilled
his name was isaac, silent, blessed
a mute whose tongue impressed her lately
but now red skies darken
the roonks lament
windswept maelstroms harken
the approach of lilith's
nightmare kingdom
the woman in her astral dreams
became more vivid, livid, obscene
scatted on the throne of oayx blasphemies
emanating raw desire
and the surging urge to scream
darkness crept into her face
she stood erect
and spook of riches and their whereabouts
finding in isaac the need to place
a hidden templer necklace
lest the month run out
for now stormed the vainglorious
in her palace of mass delight
her power dawned victorious
victoria the key, her mind unfastened
by flights of morbid fancy
psychomancy, rites of ancient wrong
sweet seductions, peaked corruptions
spiking through impatient song
cold cloister kept the dead apart
at the retreat of the sacred heart
the gate to hell was forced apart
at the retreat of the sacred heart
mother's milk has soured
my life's a bolted door
and from it runs
a trail of vagrant gore
my wounds are open flowers
fragrant gifts for my encore
bouquets of praise for bleeding, towered
on the sacrificial floor
i summoned and you came
to the peel of twisted bells
to the gelid whisper of my name
i blanched, erotic danger
had me whirling like a star
to the dark advance of strangers
and then i heard you laugh
a throat of broken glass
leather stitched to weeping skin
a coat of death and suppuration
be my truth and agony
an architect for my total destruction
my erector, my dissector
my flesh will be wet for your best seduction
be my truth and agony
inventive and deranged
loves proof is in, its plain to see
the fluids we've exchanged
part of these soul killers
the gestapohood of scars
carved an ornate invitation on my heart
the scent of french vanilla
with the stench of abattoirs
past tense of present lay things
on those stained red lips ajar
i summoned and you came
from the churning guts of hell
with your christmas hiss of chains
down the endless centuries
your torture bed of lust
a shrine for us to redesign
and sign in blood and rust
be my truth and agony
an architect for my total destruction
my erector, my dissector
my flesh caressed by your best corruption
be my truth and agony
inventive and deranged
love's roof is in, it's meant to be
my cells are rearranged
i suffered and you came
to the splintering of bones
winning pinnacles for my pain
raped and racked and mutilated
i raised from dregs again
autopsyturvy, back elated
in brazen arms that sacked my veins
skinnatra, take me to the stars
thrust me through to paradise
endorphins breaking fast
creature from the black abyss
teacher, sadomasochist
your tortured soul has led me
to this altered state of bliss
forgive me father, i have sinned
darkness put her painted claws in me again
her vision drowns like service wine
whispered kisses so divine
i was blessed but now i've come undone
storm clouds roll out overhead
above their master
end of all flesh, end of all days
love predicts disaster
in her precious ways
i was burned, a sacerdotal soul
by the demon queen of my dreams
infatuation turned to total control
her rose was sweet
but her thorns were barbarous
"love me
and worship me
i'll lavish you and ravish you
fulfill all wishes and fetishes too
many never want to see
many never want to know
the truth behind their fantasies
their deepest needs
let alone be shown them"
forgive me father, i have sinned
darkness put her painted claws in me again
her vision drowns like service wine
whispered kisses so divine
i was blessed but now i've come undone
nothing left to do but run
sodom rolls out modern death
on casters ever faster
end of all flesh, end of all days
the stars predict disaster
in her bastard ways
"love me
and worship me
i'll nurture you and hurt you too
fulfill all wishes for my sad aladdin"
she comes to me
like a sandstorm in an hourglass
a whirlwind of desire
i am hypnotized
to think beyond the pale
beyond heartstopping eyes
and sopping thighs
i'm won't to fail
a wicked spell cast over me
addicted to her utterly
despite the horrors that gestate
beneath the beautiful
"i'll grant you life beyond your ken
the envy of all other men
whatever vice will make you spend
eternity with me"
satan's concubine
she makes her crime scenes shine from heaven
forgive me father, i have sinned
darkness put her painted claws in me again
her vision drowns like service wine
whispered kisses so divine
i was blessed but now i've come undone
oh dear god
it is midnight in the labyrinth
the night is set to taint the painted halls
moonlight is our cue
the candelabra flicker at your passing gall
i swear they're dancing just for you
the dead leaves rustle on the manor lawns
as a light breeze whispers through
the call of wolves, the owls lament
our screams shall soon soar skyward too
mistress from the sucking pit
all the world crawls lovesick at her feet
the stars are passing observations
her voice is music, her legs go on
shes got full orchestration
and been known to use it
but trepidation is a far slicker song
amongst dull suitors
she is bright and razor sharp
a tree of woe uprooter
a viper still at heart
shes alkaline and far acidic
as sweet as clementines
this mistress from the sucking pit
all the world crawls lovesick at her feet
the stars are passing observations
her voice is music, her legs go on
she's got full orchestration
and been known to use it
but trepidation is a far slicker song
mistress from the sucking pit
oh dear god
it is midnight in the labyrinth
embossed by her postulant gaze
like medusa on a plinth
i am lost in her embrace
oh dear god
it is midnight in the labyrinth
a peacock fan of sinful eyes
swim wide across the room
this night, espied, your thin disguise
does wonders for the sundered gloom
for all lit up the shades retreat
to dark italian pews
and corners where great vases stand
abrim with thoughts of naked dais with you
mistress from the sucking pit
all the world crawls lovesick at her feet
the stars are passing observations
her needs are dire, her rites are wrong
she burns with exultation like a fiery vampire
for desperation is a far slicker song
amongst dull suitors
she's bright and razor sharp
a tree of woe uprooter
a viper still at heart
she's alkaline and far acidic
fluidic, serpentine
this mistress from the sucking pit
the waiters pass in gilded frames
with glasses sparkling too
the ball tonight rows magical
like the finest venice threw
and at it's heart a mythic queen
her skin of purest hue
whose beauty is unquestionable
but whose duties are askew
for beneath the airs and divine graces
a slim tornado whirls
on the precipice of her poisonous kiss
the devil dwells deep inside this girl
embossed by her postulant gaze
like medusa on a plinth
i am lost in her embrace
oh dear god
it is midnight in the labyrinth
embossed by her postulant gaze
like medusa on a plinth
i am lost in her embrace
oh dear god
it is midnight in the labyrinth
mistress from the sucking pit
the wine has sat and breathed it's last
in blood red ruby where
i find you by the roaring hearth
a blaze of golden hair
cascading down an angel's face
to pool about the breasts
that man minds have wondered on
but only i caress
and then i'm yours, the velvet crown
of venus in my hands
fists rip hard the eiderdown
desire firebrands
every mountain, every route
my wanton tongue must take
to taste that once forbidden fruit
before your bloodlust starts to
special fan edition track
i have come from the freezing seas
from the warmth of foreign coals
through the dismal fog of insecurities
to a cloudenshrouded noble goal
the world has cast me from its laughter
thrown to the wolves, to the dread thereafter
so now i forge a journey fraught
through these bitter wastes of snow
over ice and gorge to an eden sought
far from the human races afterglow
this sightless climb is treacherous to weather
as the cold bites deep, old heartstrings sever
behind the jagged mountains
beyond the frozen north
at the back of boreas. the zealous wind
there crest celestial fountains
crystal waters soaring forth
in the realm of our sacred angelus kin
neither muse nor music flees
this garden of delights
everywhere the soothing hands of nature please
in this state of pure euphoria
paradise lies at the heart of darkness
and one must pay for this deep catharsis
now the stormclouds retch
a vision fleets before my eyes
wherein minarets and spires touch
phantasmagoric skies
and meadows stretch to woodlands
of sweet nymph and fireflies
death is in the breeze
and his mind will paralyse
my mind is in the clutch
of something too long fantasised
behind the jagged mountains
beyond the frozen peaks
at the back of boreas, the zealous wind
the gods of love are counting
down the nights until we meet
in the realm of oursacred angelus kin
now the mirage blears
and the howling gusts renew their fury
the gleam of moonlit towers
fades to utter fear
the mountains rear in anger
at the righteousness i lack
and in their monstrous grasp i know
dear god
they will never let me back...
free of enemies, no death, disease
the doves of peace, in flight
carouse upon the eversummer breeze
in this land of hyperborea
behind the jagged mountains
beyond their icy stares
at the back of boreas, the zealous wind
my soul is now surmounting
past the grasp of last despairs
to the realm of our sacred angelus kin
behind the jagged mountains
beyond the frozen north
all mirrors lead to my palace
my exotic pleasure temple
wherein my court is both
gracious and insatiable, pure and obscene
for where pumps the true heart of life
there too seeps corruption
and from this my new eden of nightshades
black henbane, sphinxes
opium and roses weaned on tears and blood
will rise up like lust
and the shadow of my dark consort
shalt extend himself
across the face of the world
and hell will come with him
part of the garden, her dark eden
fed blood by poisoned fronds
my heart hardened in her wet season
treading mud in her slough of despond
but only now
a path lies straight before me
the maze is ploughed half through with hate
andpher crop is dripping red
beyond eleventh hour
her beauty and brute power
grows stronger by the day
and with each rose that she deflowers
the longer her throes of madness stay
in her grip on shredded sheets
once our fingertips had dug and clutched
she whispered dreadful things to me
she wanted war with god
the underdog baring sharpened teeth
with her armies raised from suffering
to ascend on jet black wings
she'd break off holy limbs
on the racks of her witch hunt
and crush the church beneath her heel
the pope in homage to her cunt
a dark horse forcing nightmares
to wring submissive dry
a vampire madam batterfang
with vicious streaks, a mile wide
beyond eleventh hour
her kiss has turned dismissive
her glance holds slight contempt
instead those eyes burn on the prize
of fates she really likes to tempt
in her grip on shredded sheets
gasping from conquered peaks of passion
she whispered dreadful things to me
she wanted war with god
the underdog baring sharpened teeth
with her armies raised from suffering
to ascend on jet black wings
she'd tear down mighty spires
then rear them up anew
orders forged to her desires
the eleventh hour nearly through
lilith, the abyss, the slithering mists
that cause all souls to stray
how to resist those seductive gifts
on the shore of her unholy ways?
she calls my name so softly
from deep banks of scented fog
i almost lose myself before it starts
but my spirit keeps its silence
as i drift across the lake
a glimpse of harem secrets
now her velvet curtain parts
she is glaring like the moon
the wind dies down, eavesdropping
as i bow before her throne
and she descends to greet me
like the royal bitch to which she's grown
come closer, what have you to say?
black cat got your tongue?"
i am not your slave
nor are you my savior
but isaac, i'm the only one
i hold those cold deceiving eyes
her once hypnotic gaze
and pledge eternal love then walk away
thunder seethes behind me
death adjusts her favorite mask
another lover smothered
by her sanguinary darkness
clasped in the garden, here you heard
this story blustered through
i asked her pardon, swore my word
i'd score her sweetmeats just like you
for only now
the truth lies prone before me
i couldn't leave her even if she stormed
the heavens as were promised
beyond eleventh hour
lilith, the abyss, the slithering mists
will come for you this eve
lustrous the cusp of her lingering tryst
before those fatal kisses bleed
beyond eleventh hour
she will make of you a plaything
scant amusement for her bed
and when naked flesh forgets to sing
she'll take your fucking soul instead
midnight strikes, the candles sputter
muttering their reeking spells
i snuff their tongues, my heart aflutter
these words, i speak are gates to hell
at the very start
there were whispers in the dark
and for all the world to see
there was witchcraft at its heart
and on the autumn air
the scent of bonfires everywhere
and a fell wind stirred the leaves
the persecution song
telltale signs of possession
little miss demeanour in the demons bed
gasps she just could not suppress
after lightsout midst the dead
and a past on which sin cast its darts of wickedness
time was running faster for disaster
strange nights were burning
in the furnace of her dreams
a name was uttered, lilith
mistress, playmate, master
such sights were stolen in the throes of ecstasy
and in the thick of all
in the black goddess's thrall
with the wood unseen for trees
victoria stood tall
promiscuous in step
the devil breathing down her neck
as jealous zealots stitched apiece
the persecution song
telltale signs of possession
fickle miss demeanour hissed and disappeared
to her sisters of the cloth
she now reeked of astaroth
again the curse had surfaced
sneaking back the pagan years
weaving webs of great revealing
hidden in the convent
an evil libido abided, undone
breathing, deceiving
feasting on her deviant feelings
she'd clung to her crucifix
once her torturers begun
her screams came quick
the miserichord
den to vice and screw
that had reddened many tongues
wrung symphonies
of suffering from her
many moons hardened pure hearts
those plagued by her black arts
their rooms secreting phantom orgies
vile rites and rifled graves
mere hours, now towered
above this bent and beaten flower
her naked body privy to
the abbess and her ways
victoria fought
no guilt was wrought
just a torrid retort of blasphemies
nails and crosses vomited forth
from this pretty little whore now arched like hell
arched like hell
at the very start
there were whispers in the dark
and for all the world to see
there was witchcraft at its heart
but then the end grew nigh
a dirge inferno filled the sky
in its customary key
the persecution song
telltale signs of obsession
no wailing banshee would dishonor their name
nuns dragged her to the blasted oak
stormclouds threatened holy smoke
they hanged her there like judas
with the hellcat in her reined
time was running faster for disaster
exorcism, torture, gallows
now a shallow grave
a name was stuttered, isaac
tonguetied, simple, bastard
they made him dig the pit
mindless of what it claimed
poets racking absinthed brains
could never fully paint these nights
no martyr parting from his pain
could utter words so erudite
as those she now divulged to me
in throes of passions grip
indulging latent fantasies
that ran forked tongues along the lip
of fate's pudenda
the twisted snake's agenda
now the world would bend
to her deadly legacy
life's graveyard was waiting, such dizzying flight
from the convent at all hallows fair
without contemplating, we fled through the night
too blooddrunk and cuntsated to care
the goddess had spoken
and woken desire
it crackled in the air around us
a psychic force shimmering like fire
and on her breasts. that old necklace
the one i snuck from the fucked abbess
whose dirty little secret, other than me
now shone with bold intensity
vast the power it possessed
the darkness brought to living flesh
this treasure was ancient, taken by force
from an elite caste of priests in delphi
the templars were patient, they stayed out the course
then fleeced their greek hosts in their sleep
that necklace traversed
vile murders and miles worse
but what was a curse
to this perverse demoness?
legend swore it was a gift of malice
for the maiden harmonia
the illegitimate spawn of love arid war
jealousy made it gleam for her
for with it clasped, her looking glass
was ever beautiful and young
but disaster choked her royal caste
and every throat on which it hung
there madness, death and horror clung
immortalised in mortal guise
she was a sight for blighted eyes
a plague to gladly plagiarize
and spread like red excited kisses
she was more than me
more than wards
could fulfill in the parlance of the angels
she cast a spell on every cell
in my nobody
she gave me back my tongue
that she might run it on herself
she was lilith. she was light
i was but a parasite
beckoned to temptation
in her velvet overtones
through frozen antics, dressed in white
she led me into paradise
neath comets in ovation
like the queen of winter, throned...
pleasures archetypal
then much rarer agonies
i was a sworn disciple
of her whims and dark decrees
in europe's hair
her spies were everywhere
a sylph amongst the filthy rich and debonair
her greater plan
all chaos and the all of man
for as she fed dark appetites
she bred her children there
the spawn of love and war
presiding over hellfire clubs
archmasons and agharta
the spawn of love and war
she rode the beast. her legs apart
a blazing pyre starter
life's playground elated, such dizzying sights
and sensations ignited her grin
as slaves celebrated her satanic rites
we climbed up to heaven in sin
she came to me
as she will come to you
intoxicating in her seduction
her siren sway. devastating voodoo
persistent, resistance is useless, fool
to this goddess, in lust she's cruel
beyond any measure, her pleasures will found
a perverted eden on sacred ground
vast the power i caressed
the darkness brought to vivid flesh
and in it she now rules a cowered universe
where does the madness end?
how far down do the rungs expire
in smoke and burning heat?
in depravity and sin?
in her shocking retinue
i saw the worst
desire run amok amongst you
and in her boudoir too
the endless nights embedded
in her beautiful cocoon
turning black and blue and jaded
kneelin' at her feet
my heart atrophied at her ravishing form
the ultimate test
her cult obsessed
with this body of the goddess reborn
when she first laid me to rest
i saw such sights of wickedness
from this harlot on a pedestal
this scarlet woman scorned
i glimpsed desertion, the bluster of shame
the tribes of the moon. their luster improved
a morbid aversion to the limpid domain
of eden and adam her dark temper moved
i witnessed reverie then
perverse resurgence, souls on fire
blood and seed spilt for centuries
for this imperious bitch
in her shocking retinue
i saw the worst
desire run amok amongst you
a gnawer of taboo
dread appetites were threaded
right throughout the mortal zoo
her immortality now hungered
i remember, in thebes
enthroned with catskinned girls
her long dark hair braided with pearls
a red gown split revealed her thighs
as full lips rose to feline eyes
egyptian black outlined each lid
it's clear who owned the pyramid
temptress lilith
her beauty stirred me more than words
could ever paint, her bible hurt
tempered lilith
hissing in the dark
pissing on my heart
i was missing every part of victoria
victoria
i found them hypnotic, the years of display
of court life and parties, political bite
narcotic, erotic, her bleary soirees
left daylight a dream in the scheme of the night
the scheme of the night
but i grew uneasy, she wanted the earth
for now she was spinning her sins
breeding fell children and hiding her worth
before the new orders disorder begins
feeding from the weak
savaged on their feet by her ravaging lust
eveningdressed
this young countess
led lovers astray under cover of dusk
when she took them to her breast
they passed last rites, deliciousness
swept into their every pore
this matriarch of darkness bored
harlot on a pedestal
the night orchestral
harlot on a pedestal
never vestal
ebony dressed for sunset
unshadow thyselves children
the reign in flesh begins again...
v empire
funereal majesty awake
cneajna wreathed in snake
draconis talons rake...
so haunted is my silent heart
dreaming only of the moon
when velvet darkness falls tonight
the thirst crescends anew...
only for you
inspired to mortal nightmare
ebony dressed for sunset
in the dulcet whispers of the damned...
black candles dance to an overture
but i am drawn past their flickering lure
to the breathing forest that surrounds the room
where the vigilant trees push out of the womb
i sip the bloodred wine
my thoughts weigh heavy with the burden of time
from knowledge drunk from the fountain of life
from chaos born out of love and the scythe
the forest beckons with her nocturnal call
to pull me close amid the baying of wolves
where the bindings of christ are downtrodden with scorn
in the dark, odiferous earth
we embrace like two lovers at death
a monument to the trapping of breath
as restriction is bled from the veins of my neck
to drop roses on my marbled breast
i lust for the wind and the flurry of leaves
and the perfume of flesh on the murderous breeze
to learn from the dark and the voices between
this is my will...
the forest whispers my name...again and again
when the moon is full
we shall assemble to adore
the potent spirit of your queen,
my mother great diana.
she who fain would learn all sorcery
yet has not won its deepest secrets,
then my mother will
teach her, in truth
all things as yet unknown
i walk the path
to the land of the dark immortals
where the hungry ones will carry my soul
as the wild hunt careers through the boughs
come to me, my pale enchantress
in the moon of the woods we kiss
artemis be near me
in the arms of the ancient oak
where daylight hangs by a lunar noose
and the horned, hidden one is reinvoked
the principle of evil
evolution has been recalled
beneath the spread of a magickal aeon
i stand enthralled
...in the whispering forest
"pale, beyond porch and portal,
crowned with leaves, she stands,
who gathers all things mortal,
with cold immortal hands,
her languid lips are sweeter,
than love's who fears to greet her,
to men that mix and meet her,
from many times and lands."
hosannas in extremis
invading temptuous skies
when inanna rose, bringing angels repose
and narcissus' fate as their prize
blinded by diana's mirror
where in coffined truth struggles, forlorn
and covetous stars out their eyes to deceive
the horrors performed on her shores
as jewelled ishtar, in darker aeons
trespassed ereshkigal's grasp
her ravening twin, wreathed in whispers and wind
now inspires catharsis to dance
through the weave of white vaults
where the shadows revolt
at the incest of spiritual love
castrata choirs, bereft of such lusts
spatter virginal breasts with their blood
the iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve
thirstridden wolves serenade a moon
who seems no mistress of herself
and heavens pour forth vast casualties
thy host given up for me
thou which wert once and then ceased to be
art now ensconced to chapters
of a lengthening tragedy
whilst we scream free
deep forests impale the sinister mist
their sorcery taught to the clouds
who muster like mountains, a fountainous wish
to vex the sweet dead from silk odious shrouds
stormwoken sisters of judas unfurl
as psyche to sapphic lament
wrapt in thy tresses and taloned caresses
whisper me secrets beheld beyond death
"desires
i was loath to lose
to the virginbloodied priests
whose lord fantasied on magdalene
and sought to savour her as beast
her aching sex
a rose undone
as mine in tears and spams wrung"
ebon nemesis, slain jericho's stone
has built thee a marbled stair
by candlelight to eden and a serpentine throne
where ravens rape the tenanting angels there
hurry, else death may spy us here
and quicken the pulse of dawn
embering flames writhe to life again
the starry brow threshed with poisonous thorn
huntress, draw back the silvered bow
thy dogs set upon the manger
the enemy in throes...
whilst drifting fogs devour
all hallows witching hour
on this long, dark seance for the soul
through male volent scylla, charybdis graves
our conquesting spirits pour forth, unassuaged
occultnesses watch us and seraph, afraid
like fireflies plunge to her maw, midst crashing black waves
"remember with pride what thou art
lest we forget in awe of our terrible past"
when dark royalties drank of despair
idols hewed down 'neath a desert god's stare
in thrall to revenges sworn there
what dreams could we father, when farther we fell
to nightmare...?
"well versed in misery
we have lain naked in darkest ravines
now the sun has set in slumber, we delight
like serpents in arousal
coiled to strike at the light"
now abyssed lucifers master the earth
uncloister jaded harlots once served
enthralled by cruel raptures, rehearsed
kiss slumbered beauty and weapon our thousand year curse
the laughter of khaos
gatekeepers flee the onslaught
a world enslaved to flame
bondage in phallustine
pleasure temples for my bride
nubian grace swiftly seize
thieves blooddivine
empires thrive on sacrifice
iniquitous
i share carmilla's mask
a gaunt mephitic voyeur
on the black side of the glass
peering through the mirror
deep dark and ominous
consorting themes, demons i weave
subservience from thee to lust
i am corinthian light
sharpeyed, impassive whore
burn the asafoetida
and rank petriachor
lure me panthered faustia
with cunt and veiled womb
to prowl thy inner sanctum walls
in tirgoviste to resume
control
seduction, my obsessive art
a pantheon of tragedies inscribed upon the stars
like thistled ruin, garbed around thy heart
bacchanal cinderella, desirious midnight passed
leaving thee as sacrifice asleep within my arms
'midst dreams of robed redemption versed in sexual aftermath
when we ebb as tides together, carnal souls entwined
and orgasms expire, come puppet wires and the blind
purge
fires work in me
a lithe supremacy
i tear asunder heaven as i would all enemies
impaler lord
flesh upon the sword
my lower lusts are sated, the greater herald war
i am thirst, spearheaded hunger
sacrament and pain
nails raked in savagery
when the cruel countessa came
exalt!
the queen of deathwhite winter enthroned
evil resplendent, in dusk red seething skies
foamflecked nightmares drag a moon
of draconian design
a love that never dies
nefarious as her winds
stirring silhouettes to rise
when stars fall pale
and to drown back in her eyes
is to madden ghosts within
to unhinge a thousand sins
from death's dark vale
"blessed be these spells of winter
unto us that wait with patience in
this secret garden
to storm our way into another
as yes undone"
surge
desert claims eden
and hyperborean
visions of utopia are driven from the sun
iconoclast
before thee angels clasped
in nakedness their ochre flesh
shall yield to thy advance
she is all to me
mysterious, alive
the howling in the deep woods
when cold festal stars aligned
a lurid moon looms phosphorent, evil
yesod vested in despotic upheaval
silvering wolves that scarlet forest snow
forgotten ones enter as above, so below
the trees groan aghast as ghostly pallored clouds are rent
when the drunken earth heaves, sweep aside seas to ascend
from sheol's dank haunted wilderness
thy seal upon nuit's starry vault to incense the sleepers, dead
queen of winter, throned
the murderess lurked in vulgar caresses
vestal masturbation
purity overthrown
darkness
in raven feathered dress
sides with death at chess
their pawns are many and the enemy
powerless
when the miscreants fell dead
she took to conjuring spells in the cusp of the night
and the bestial floor shook with terrible life
i rise before thee queen
to feed our lusts on the blood of the weak
to rule heaven and worlds crawling beneath
satanic tyranny
hasten to the bridal bed 
underneath the grave 'tis spread:
in darkness may our love be hid,
oblivion be our coverlid 
we may rest, and none forbid.
percy bysshe shelley
nocturnal supremacy
weak midnight promises of love
were wept upon her grave
and shunned by stars above
in mortal life lurks my dismay
an angel stole my heart
and death took her away
she sleeps beyond the grace of god
a dreaming beauty
if wishes could only fray that bond
the dead would sing for me...
twelth moon arose with ghostly voice
a poet's serenade
her name a whisper 'pon my lips
and lo, rorasa came
fear me not my grieving king
funereal in breath
the secrets of the dark i know
and thus, we shall cheat death"
my promises wrought though despondence that night
have delivered me gifts from the grave
rorasa enshadowed and eternal life
never a devil so vain
the angel is fallen, for i thought her lost
and no heaven would silence the pain
teach me these secrets, the sensual frost
desire for warm blood again
princess lay down thy florid cheek
in drunken splendour
tonight rare regal fate has cast
the wolves among the sheep
dark nature clasp my soul
around her throat mine arms enfold
to sleep, perchance to dream
and then...
to dusk and flesh ascend
the sun descends, magenta spirits fill the skies
and wreak erotic maladies where sex and death abide
from writhing tides where gothick siren weave their song to
shore
through the ashes of the battlefields where ravens and angels
war
as phantoms we have fled the basilisk of day
to rise as phoenix taloned, nightly taking prey
we rule like the red and risen moon upon the sea
the stars of judgement silent, for we share joyous
eternity
damnation
salvation
stigmata plague
the wine of bacchus flows
listen to the thunder rage
deceivers dragged before their cross
i am he that vanquished death
and bore the sting of loss
what vulgar christ will unprise my grasp?
his temple, ruined, burns
and sweet rorasa laughs
i am enamoured and imparadised
to catch the fires dancing profanely in her eyes
"i will crush them all
if this holds thy delight"
rather dead forever than to lose her
nymphlascivious aphrodite
welcome with a stench of misadventure
libertines and sibling things a grim
slither forth through the gateway's hissing denture
the moon, one up on the chateau battlements
gilds this torchlit drive to shangrila
this solstice calls like the piper to rodentia
come join this hive of masqueraders
this eve is pure and pagan
its teeth are in the past
dark royalties of ancient caste
feast in splendour
for your vulgar delectation
decreed
that hunger shall be sated by the dawn
in marble ballrooms
of delight
the erotic and the wicked dance alike
virgin cunts aquiver at this foreplay for the spiteful
the cellars smelt abrim
with cracked wine and racked women
are spiced for even marquis appitites
screams an aphrodisiac
for the blackest ever nightfall
lords, heed the call
vast boudours here
are mastered by the minatory
walls plastered with the base relief
of baser glories
ma cherie debauchery
deflower of my life untie their bonds
and push these fantasies
to ever greater stories
for your vulgar delectation
inhibit nothing, run free
loose sore cateries before me
ripped, prolific scars
are titbits on which to feed
the heathen hour strikes
wrong, the rites
beasts ravage for your soul
as lovely entrapment snaps
her fingers, hell comes crawling
this eve is pure and pagan
its teeth are in the past
let the cream of sinners learn at last
for your vulgar delectation
decreed
that hunger shall be sated by the dawn
dawn...
bursting, aghast
with the judgement that we spend upon the evil
we feed eternal hungriness
exceeding vile deeds that were freed in this cathedral
for your vulgar delectation
decreed
that horrors shall be waited on the
ones who crave sin's innovations
spawned wanton like blight on an auspicious night
her eyes betrayed spells of the moon's eerie light
a disquieting gaze forever ghosting far seas
bled white and dead, her true mother was fed
to the ravenous wolves that the elements led
from cragjagged mountains that seemingly grew in unease
through the maw of the woods, a black carriage was drawn
flanked by barbed lightning that hissed of the storm
gilded in crests of carpathian breed
bringing slaves to the sodomite for the newborn
on that eve when the countess' own came deformed
a tragedy crept to the name bathory
elizabeth christened, no paler a rose
grew so dark as this sylph
none more cold in repose
yet her beauty spun webs
round hearts a glance would betroth
she feared the light
so when she fell like a sinner to vice
under austere, puritanical rule
she sacrificed
mandragora like virgins to rats in the wall
but after whipangels licked prisoners, thralled
never were her dreams so maniacally cruel
and possessed of such delights
for ravens winged her nightly flights
of erotica
half spurned from the pulpit
torments to occur
half learnt from the cabal of demons
in her
her walk went to voodoo
to see her own shadow adored
at mass without flaw
though inwards she abhored
not her coven of suitors
but the stare of their lord
"i must avert mine eyes to hymns
for his gaze brings dogmas to my skin
he knows that i dreamt of carnal rites
with him undead for three long nights"
elizabeth listened
no sermons intoned
dragged such guilt to her door
tombed her soul with such stone
for she swore the priest sighed
when she knelt down to atone
she feared the light
so when she fell
like a sinner to vice
under austere, puritanical rule
she sacrificed
her decorum as chaste
to this wolf of the cloth
pouncing to haunt
her confessional box
forgiveness would come
when her sins were washed off
by rebaptism in white
the looking glass cast belladonna wreaths
'pon the grave of her innocence
her hidden face spat murder
from a whisper to a scream
all sleep seemed cursed
in faustian verse
but there in orgiastic hell
no horrors were worse
than the mirrored revelation
the she kissed the devil's phallus
by her own decree
so with windows flung wide to the menstrual sky
solstice eve she fled the castle in secret
a daughter of the storm, astride her favourite nightmare
on winds without prayer
stigmata still wept between her legs
a cold bloodedness which impressed new hatreds
she sought the sorceress
through the snow and dank woods to the sodomite's lair
nine twisted fates threw hewn bone die
for the throat of elizabeth
damnation won and urged the moon
in soliloquy to gleam
twixt the trees in shafts
to ghost a path
past the howl of buggered nymphs
in the sodomite's grasp
to the forest's vulva
where the witch scholared her
in even darker themes
"amongst philtres and melissas
midst the grease of strangled men
and eldritch truths, elder illomen
elizabeth came to life again"
and under lacerations of dawn she returned
like a flame unto a deathshead
with a promise to burn
secrets brooded as she rode
through mist and marsh to where they showed
her castle walls wherein the restless
counted carrion crows
she awoke from a fable to mourning
church bells wringing her madly from sleep
tolled by a priest, self castrated and hung
like a crimson bat 'neath the belfry
the biblical prattled their mantras
hexes sixtripled their fees
but elizabeth laughed, thirteen autumns had passed
and she was a widow from god and his wrath, finally
through arcades where shimmering snowfall
lay in state with the sad and damned
a rent lament barely flung above a whisper
drew me like a ghost to the haunts of man
i found her tempting fate between her wrist and razor
a kindred spirit in a graveyard
beneath the stature of a colder saviour
mist hung like thieves wreathed in scant arabesques
and through the chill earth it bedwed her drawling breast
like a come dream true under etched glass spent
making love to the beautiful dead
she has sinned and severed heaven
and in it's vulgar sight
two figures writhe, but one silhouette
extends it's fingers to the light
"gothic towers tottered on her heels
as she fled asylum grounds
committing hard crimes to soft cells
where now another's screams resound"
from the gaspings in her passing
six feet under or beneath frayed gown
when her hands pointed to midnight
in a white stained chamber bound
i swept her from the abyss of another dementia
freeing her soul from the fetters of fate
to take the reins of pleasure
now nightwane mirrors freeze in seizure
at the glimpse of charmed pins in her thighs
ballrooms filled with black cats scratch
out of spite and playful eyes
pricked as a witch her stitches itch
for familiar lips to lick them dry
whilst the dark regrasps, for if she asks
the sun forsakes the right to rise
and is the first to discern, that this angel's return
is a vengefull call on grace
for even martyrdom backs from it's suicide pacts
a leap of twisted fate betrayed
the scars will last until the stars
caught in her train bewitched
fall into line and yield the sign
that dawn in born to their eclipse
for our in humankind
comes an underdog day sunrise
rippling with fire llike femaledition
iplintered her coffin and lay on the floor
of a vault with her clasped as the moon hugs the shore
what treachery this that she breathed no more?
christ you bastard!
i wished her back but the dead adored her
even wild winds sang in chora for her
saffron from my heart, from the start i swore
we'd be together more
creation froze with the triumph of death
but still she stirred and awoke bereft
of concern save for the aeons left
to lead the darkness
she schemes of growing power and the lengths sucked hard to get it
i dream of being god but ever living to regret it
our fecund nature decrees that jesus wept come for
the devil on her knees
to grant her lows a remedy
and mine desire's wish
to taste thereof of heaven's scent
as sick and twisted as it is
for her corset laced with arsenic
hides snake curves within her midst
whilst her halo of white lies supplies
her temple to what god forbids.
as lonely as a poet on the walls of jericho
or the moon without the comfort of the stars
i am loathe to know it that a man without a soul
is nothing but a spilled canopic jar
i proved it
improved it
drove a sonnet
right through it
and in this state of bliss
evil kissed with wet lips
penfilled fingertips
which through me
for through me
illuminati usually pissed
but with words of some hurts worth
i threw a party that extended god's list
exciting new flames that my fame would claim for me
reciting back the almanac of travesties
they call me bad
mad caliban with manners
dangerous to know
a passing fad
taught in all debauch
in excess and in canto
grown wild
this child
whole harems defiled
faustina's and mina's
lady libertine and her sisters between her
what spread of lies arise when lovers die
which circle of hell is mine when i arrive
they call me bad
mad caliban with manners
dangerous to know
a passing fad
taught in all debauch
crow against the virgin snow
grown colder, my shoulder
like a boulder beside her
and bolder, not wiser
my dark seed took up root inside her
that mouldered, where older
beddings would hold a passionate sigh
but laudanum and soda
lord numb coda
merited a forest of inherited spite
fleeing grief for foreign maps
i still played vampire aristocrat
unloading my gun in hot, promiscuous laps
then shooting swans in a gondola
i tripped my foot on a fallen star
and there's nothing like a mouthful of venetian tar
to let you know just who you fucking are
ville
the patron saint of heartache
i can't see my world is falling
the world is falling down
the patron saint of heartache
i can't see my world is falling
the world is falling down
dani
everafter can they hear my laughter
ville
the patron saint of heartache
dani
never craft a better bed of disaster
ville
the patron saint of heartache
they call me bad
mad caliban with manners
dangerous to know
a passing fad
taught in all debauch
in excess and in canto
they call me bad
mad caliban with manners
dangerous to know
a passing fad
whereupon i tell them
to go fuck their mothers
as so....
on my grave
with the snow fallen thick
and bonfires alit
and shooting stars portents of rips
i ascended to spur
a mere glimpse or murmur
from her precious celestial lips
be it sun to your moon
be it moon to your sun
together we promised to come
with a turn of the screw
and a slip of the tongue
we eclipsed one another undone
through the mists, through the woods
with the nightwraiths i??ve stood
atop murderous peaks calling you
on stormlashed beachheads
where the fishermen dread
the things your bewitchments accrue
those deep creatures bring
her cut diamond rings
a girl with a pearl necklace her
advancing in fevers
tsunamis and myrrh
will she wreak bloody vengeance or purr?
or will she burn?
she lights the skies
dressed in silver scales plucked from the ocean
to spite her thighs
that lucifer snuck inside
and with his pride
enclaves were upgraded to goshen
so paradise
could shine from out her skirts
??i adorn myself at dusk
with ornaments to close the noose
a kiss as red as blood and cold as hell
my body glows with lust
anaemic as the flag of truce
i raised at dawn to catch you in my spell??
with every twist i cannot resist her
fertile female mind control
this wanton witch, whiterapids sister
to whom i pour my wine and soul
and here we go again!
from a corpse of black pews
where the moon was drawn through
like a sword through a gordian knot
she descended to me
claiming swift victory
over the heart i had nearsoon forgot
with every kiss this huntress whispered:
??yield to my sweet embrace
one night of bliss.?? i could not dismiss her
once her beauty shot me a darker face
you mesmerise my soul diana
you mesmerise my soul
instrumental
a thousand nights once succored me
in the shadow of miss anne thropy
sat gargoylelimbed amid my licking flame
a cruel tongue at work in her secret vaults
sent rebellion's embers into revolt
the coming of extinction
synced to whimpers of my name
legion i arose, a flood of inhumanity
an acid reign to purify the world
the asp at pharaoh's breast
the atom split under duress
a sniper at the gates of spattered pearl
my heart, torn apart, left a rifled grave
save for an unfurled flag of hate
to enthrall a mindless zombie race
all hail, all hail, all hail the serpentine's gift
all hail, love fails, all hope lies in eclipse
black bibles i inscribed,
the words "damnation through design"
seemed a bitter truth far better for the lie
for as hope was felled by reason
forlorn became the season
and death was swift to swallow on the hells of life
lowered souls, growing cold, tendered easy prey
when heaven's flock, a fair game, dropped
i bored of war with god with greater thrones to claim
all hail, all hail, all hail the libertine's wish
all hail, love fails, all hope lies in eclipse
there was not a prayer left in this wretched world
then between the past and the ravening dark
a sly messiah came
in the thick of treaty with obligatory greed
she stole the soul hate had sold away
an ancient chill blew down the centuries
that night atonement's eyes
lit a burning man in me
when love lay bleeding
and fates sate feeding
from wounds gored 'neath
those cherubic wings
she of kindred light
gladly sacrificed
eternity
just to be
with me
as the moon whose silvered fingers play
on words and dreams too cursed for day
she led my hand to lands i'd not accrued
where the faun dawn bathed her golden hair
and faith renewed, leapt joyous there
i praised their worth, then planned their conquest too
all hail, all hail, all hail the serpentine's gift
all hail, love fails, all hope lies in eclipse
all hail, all hail, all hail the libertine's wish
all hail, love fails, all hope lies in eclipse
and ignorance is truly bliss
and there was war in heaven
michael and his angels fought against the dragon
and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not
neither was their place found anymore in heaven
and the great dragon was cast out
that old serpent called the devil and satan"
which deceiveth the whole world
he was cast out into the earth
and his angels were cast out with him
our father
who art in heaven
hallowed be thy name
thy kingdom come
thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven
give us this day our daily bread
and forgive us our trespasses
as we forgive those who trespass against us
and lead us not into temptation
but deliver us from evil
for thy is the kingdom
and the power and the glory
forever and ever
amen
unverified
i pace, alone
in a place for the dead
overcome by woe
and here, i've grown
so fond of dread
that i swear it's heaven
oh sweet mary,
dressed in gray
roll back the stone
with these words scrawled in a severed hand
tears fall like shards of glass that bend
in rivers, like sinners
swept with me to join the damned
a darkened sky
the day that laughter died
fell swiftly into night
and stayed within her sight
staring at the knife
oh god, how easy now to sacrifice
my life, to have her with me
so farewell to distant thunder
those inept stars i've worshipped under
fall farther, their father
lies in wait in flames below
whilst my love, a blood red flower
calls to me from verdant bowers
graveside, i cry
please save me from this hell i know
a darkened sky
the day that laughter died
fell swiftly into night
and stayed within her sight
staring at the knife
oh god, how easy now to sacrifice
my life, to have her with me
an eye for an eye as espied in the bible
my faith is lost to the burning of idols
one less cross to press upon the survival
of this lorded agony
and i, much as i have tried
to bury her from mind,
fate's tourniquet was tied, when she died
still sense her presence so divine
lithe arms about my throat
like pining swans entwined
footfalls at nightfall close to mine
suicide is a tried and tested formula for release
i snatch her whisper like the wind through cedars
see her face in every natural feature
midst the mist and sleepy hollows of fever
with glee deceiving me
suicide is a tried and tested formula for release
i hear her voice from where the grave defies her
siren song to sing along, no finer
suicide notes, harmonized in a minor
strike a chord with misery
no light nor reef
no unsinkable of romance keeps me
safely from the stormy seas
now drowning, resounding
deathknells pound my dreams
unthinkable to dredge through this
listless and lonely winter freeze
a darkened sky
this day hereafter dies
falls swiftly into night
and stays within my sight
staring at the knife
oh god, what ease it was to sacrifice
my life, to have her with me
no more a victim of crusade
where souls are strung from moral palisades
i slit my wrist and quickly slip away
i journey now on jeweled sands
beneath a moon to summer lands
to grace her lips with contraband
the blaze once in my veins
as pride precedes a downfall, so he took his place before the firewall
of dissonant choirs whose faith in one
was embraced in this wraith whose fate was hung
between forgiveness and the damage done
an electric scent over drear decay
lent a violent surge to their serenades
through white glades as his winged parade
bent to silhouette and to sharpen dull razors
within vast skies unversed in starkness
his might grew
and blew light hues to gray
and worse, a third of stars to darkness
then thunder seethed and wreathed in thickening night
a line was drawn midst wrong and right and across the throats of thieves
as love fell choked, the tempest broke from heaven's farthest shore
descending to eclipse all hope, repentance might stay holy war
he would not heel nor fake a bow
murmur curses to the wind
enraged, he raved in a balrog howls
upon a storm firstborn of sin
incensed anew, rebellions tore
like frenzied beasts of prey
through temple doors
through east before the midnight masses
and where once bliss reigned so serene
in sweeter glades
now veins ran openly
like eyes that shied from kindred ashes
when suddenly there shone a hideous light
and a voice like three inanities soared up in thistled speech
thou hast bred hate where there dwelt none and for this grave mistake
how thou art falling morning sun
the proud will be abased
he would not heel
nor fake a bow
murmur curses to the wind
and lo the wrath of god swept down
thou art no more an angel filled with light
but a leech to be abhorred
and thou shalt suffer my burning will
quoth this raven nevermore
never fucking more
and with these words like heavy stone cast against that gilded throne
with many legions still in tow, he turned his wings to flee
his eyes a picture of distaste, dawn to tears and in their place
the dawn of time and fates to face, through all eternity
i wept for him a deep red river that ran like blood through scarred ravines
to sluice away the guilt that slithered like a serpent tongue to eve
for once as i in heaven climbed too high for truth to truly see
my sunken mind, drunken and blind, saw the lie that fool was me
alone and cold, face to the crack
beyond dark gates with no way back
his crown of gold faded to black
like a bruise upon the heart that lingers
with thrillkill
culture shock wave lengths
of rope to hang high
ten commandments by snaked about his upraised fingers
sister midnight comes blaspheming
screaming in the keys of faith and fear
unentwining, our spines twists me to kneeling
spilling like the moonlight on her glistening rear
defiled at heart in this perfect hell
under red leaves bleeding over scaled chateau we fell
to demonocracy, where neither adam or eve
conceived of such iniquities from pleasure or pain
or the razor's edge in between
thou art my seventh heaven burning
going down as with the sun
within like a river fluids moves a torrent
bound to please on denierred knees
in any wicked way that her whims may warrant
i hang on every verb, every dirty word, interred
in her pornoglossa, christlike, whipped and weak
painted nails driven through the meek
yet in obituary, my dreams still weep
of dark blood and fucking thee
thou art my seventh heaven burning
going down as with the day
baring lunar curvature like canvas for a lick of pain
writhing like a viper deep inside her eden
forbidden to eat, i kiss leylines to her feet
then baiting wrath, i steal a path
back to the fruits of her womb
back to the crack of her tomb
her roseate sliver quivers with snuff appeal
the torque of her hips, lipsync me in for the kill
tonguetied, tightrope and spread like disease
i drain the cup of this miss sire, her water into wine for me
thou art my seventh angel squirming
'neath the forked tongue of the beast
arching toward the fabled
like a sculptured nymph seeking base relief
whilst the world outside
a wood of suicide
would die for this release
our slow orgasmic fuses greet
by night and by candle at each other's throat
in a slick drift of red, setting god's teeth on edge
we were as wolves preying inside the fold
of a slaughtered lamb throw on a four poster bed
succulent, succubus
laid without rest in the dead of the night
succulent, succubus
in thy arms and thy wetness
on glossed lips i taste
conspiracies, secrecies, sorceries laced
with thick unguent rum, blackrayed suns and autumn
always in season for our nightfall from grace
gorge upon my seed
starved persephone
succulent, succubus
that i might keep
thee with me in hades
succulent, succubus
succour me
succulent, succubus
succour me
succulent, succubus
succulent, succubus
incomprehensible
no lyrics, instrumental
i, i still recall the first full moon of may
neath whose rays we lay together
and those bright nights on glassy waves
when we would glide lightly away
from the grain for wicked flights of pleasure
those visions fade like ghosts to lifes parade
though incisions once made her so vivid
a scarlet whore with both heels in the door
of a heaven severed from me, insipid
amidst the writhe of parapets where angels sigh, lonely she sits
only a slip from whence i beg her
that i would wish her kiss, a chrysalis
to break, to make my fluttered heart amiss
and in those frozen moments won from grief
that creeps to wreathe the sun in drapes
inwove with death's head wing, i thank god for the suffering
yeah, love would have conquered all but for the rapture
that ancient plan for my defeat
denied faith skies that would have set her free
it seems again, dreams wend to capture
once, dancing in a spotlit waltz
through a shadowed dimension
given to the rivers that bedizened her eyes
the world drifted by in a lost momentum with no divine intervention
regardless that the author of sin was me
and i lay chaste of hate in faiths embrace
as mortals warred with more, besides
they warred with life itself
and in those frozen moments won from grief
that creeps to wreathe the sun in drapes
inwove with death's head wing
i thank god for the suffering
and i thank god for the suffering as still i burn for her return
i would make my peace with everything
i, i still recall, the first full moon of may
consigned to flames like secret letters
amidst the writhe of parapets where angels sigh, lonely she sits
only a slip from whence i beg her
that i would wish her kiss, a chrysalis
to break, to make my fluttered heart amiss
and in those frozen moments won from grief
that creeps to wreathe the sun in drapes
inwove with death's head wing, i thank god for the suffering
love would have conquered all, were we not parted?
her splintered loss rekindles rage
the winter frost dwindles across my stage
lit up once more to score, finale started
love would have conquered all
love would have conquered
hate, hate, hate
incomprehensible
from grief that creeps to wreathe the sun in drapes
inwove with death's head wing
i thank god for the suffering
the moon, she hangs like a cruel portrait
soft winds whisper the bidding of trees
as this tragedy starts with a shattered glass heart
and the midnightmare trampling of dreams
but no, no tears please
fear and pain may accompany death
but it is desire that shepherds it's certainty
as we shall see
she was divinity's creature
that kissed in cold mirrors
a queen of snow
far beyond compare
lips attuned to symmetry
sought her everywhere
dark liquored eyes
an arabian nightmare
she shone on watercolors
of my pond life as pearl
until those who couldn't have her
cut her free of this world
that fateful eve when
the trees stank of sunset and camphor
their lanterns chased phantoms and threw
an inquisitive glance, like the shadows they cast
on my love picking rue by the light of the moon
putting reason to flight
or to death as their way
they crept through woods mesmerized
by the taffeta ley
of her hips that held sway
over all they surveyed
save a mist on the rise
a deadly blessing to hide
her ghost in the fog
they raped left
five men of god
her ghost in the fog
dawn discovered her there
beneath the cedar's stare
silk dress torn, her raven hair
flown to gown her beauty bared
was starred with frost, i knew her lost
i wept 'til tears crept back to prayer
she'd sworn me vows in fragrant blood
"never to part
lest jealous heaven stole our hearts"
then this i screamed:
"come back to me
i was born in love with thee
so why should fate stand in between?"
and as i drowned her gentle curves
with dreams unsaid and final words
i espied a gleam trodden to earth
the church bell tower key...
the village mourned her by the by
for she'd been a witch
their men had longed to try
and i broke under christ seeking guilty signs
my tortured soul on ice
a queen of snow
far beyond compare
lips attuned to symmetry
sought her everywhere
trappistine eyes
an arabian nightmare
she was ersulie possessed
of a milky white skin
my porcelain yin
a graceful angel of sin
and so for her
the breeze stank of sunset and camphor
my lantern chased her phantom and blew
their chapel ablaze and all locked in to a pain
best reserved for judgment that their bible construed
putting reason to flight
or to flame unashamed
i swept form cries
mesmerized
by the taffeta ley
or her hips that held sway
over all those at bay
save a mist on the rise
a final blessing to hide
her ghost in the fog
and i embraced
where lovers rot
her ghost in the fog
her ghost in the fog
so adept was unspoken man
at dusting ledgers of the seraphim
that lilith swept across the broken land
in a whirl of lust to pleasure him
this bland adam, a reaper of the sun
in bone dry season, for eve was busy sucking thumbs
pricked in rosy gardens as he spattered into shells
and ran with morning fauna, his mastiffs and gazelle
breathless as the wind, adam, prowled, fell foul to sin
but not before she spread her grin, across his silent lips
at crack of day, though what was shame?
the raptor's nest wherein they lay
bore witness to her soft parade of fingers come to grips
his undivine attention won she deftly spun
from 'neath his thrusts to writhe above in ecstasy
pendulous she swung as if her limbs imbibed his tongue
to spill, as with his rod, the secret name of god
but no seed passed those fruitful lips
serpent tongue
for fearing her who grasped, he slit
serpent tongue
her throat from ear to where she fled
serpent tongue
with tail and blood between her legs
paradise, paradise, paradise
so very kept was the virgin hand
that brushed the treasures of utopia
and how the greed swept across the desert sands
in late august just to measure her
this hallowed eve, a creature of the moon
a simple dish born with a silver spoon
giddy sniffing orchids that opened after dusk
incubus and prudence, two such swoon to touch her
restless as the skies, temptation, bloomed, found room to rise
and snatching breaths between her thighs, he crawled to eve
at dead of night, the sticky clime, smelt perfect to this serpentine
this shining angel palled in mysteries
her undivine attention won he deftly spun
a web of for the one great sacred tree
bejeweled and lit as if a thousand shades did flit
about boughs of forbidden lore, hidden for the want of more
and when seeds passed those fruitful lips
serpent tongue
and mankind basked in vast eclipse
serpent tongue
a devil shot of thin disguise
serpent tongue
surmised to better paradise
it's paradise, paradise, paradise
paradise, paradise, paradise
thee i invoke, bornless one, all woman, pure predator
wherein conspiracy and impulse dwell
like a seething fall from grace
thee, i worship
thou art darkest gabrielle
lilith who rode the steed
thou art pale hecate
rising from thessaly
crush their unworthy idols
no church shall bar our path
seductive evil, drink your fill
of the bleeding christ in your arms
you are in my dreams
the darkness in my eyes
the rapture in my screams
black goddess
nothing will keep us apart
we could kill them all
if desire tore free
our union is one, sweet, sinful eve
and the night draws in beside her
as we embrace the dark side by side
i pour my soul to those eyes full of fire
to harvest the seed plowed inside her
archangel, snare the flesh
suck dry the ebbing wound
leave them lifeless and broken
my beloved
oh, how i have craved for you
you so pure and otherworldly with your scent of winter
am i to bleed myself dry
to see your delight?
and the fear retreats forever
come to me, come to me, come to me, black goddess arise
when my secrets are buried in thine
come to me, come to me, come to me, black goddess arise
under seven stars we came together
come to me, come to me, come to me, black goddess arise
to plot the new age's decline
come to me, come to me, arise
ishtar, my queen
come forth to me
and help me seize
my future from the house of death
that in the release of immortality
i should slay their fucking nazarene
ah, the lies, the jew
i kill for you
you are in my dreams
the darkness in my eyes
the rapture in my screams
black goddess
hidden lusts will break the gates and swarm
as love secretes the thrill for war
the virgin raped shall seek to whore
shewolf bare your snarling jaw
angel, angel
thee, i invoke, bornless one
all woman, pure predator
wherein conspiracy and impulse dwell
don't ring my bell
thou art darkest gabrielle
lilith who rode the steed
thou art pale hecate
rising from thessaly
libertina grimm
howitzer glare and spitfire blade
wooed by dresden serenades
her soundtrack now a bombing raid
bored of vaudeville
god was six days sober
on the night that she was born
to the glistening star of a bible class
an icon now in religious porn
she was alice through the gloryhole
an ejaculate misconception
disneyesque, the high priestess
of greed and deepest dark deception
all besttobury whims
for miss libertina grimm
she, that little red riding crop
brer werewolf at her stocking tops
beneath the tightened leather strop
of the basque of the houndervilles
at the stroke of midnight come
she polished verse and hearses
in a poisonous pen dipped in omen
to her surgeon full of general curses
in the hand of morgue redeemers
though the dead always pleased her more
squatting in her coffins
flirting curtsies to the thirteenth floor
tip your hats
for sweet libertina grimm
fantasy and candy stores
snow white and the seven straws
smoke and mirrors on all fours?
libertina grimm
her brothers grim, her sisters through
the final dance will be the cue
she amputates to fit the shoe
libertina grimm
libertina grimm
mystery kindled in a blackened room
nine candles lit to improve the gloom
she sees the dark as she feels her womb
full of hidden secrets
they haunt her heart, those precious few
those count lestats and betty blues
those tortured souls just like me and you
full of hidden secrets
no, don?t go
don?t you leave me here
so alone
libertina
no, don?t you go
don?t you leave me here
so alone
where the dead are free to roam
winter ice  terminal frost
closing eyes of the equinox
dimensional change  darkening skies
the sphere is shackled till dusk
prophet dreams  ride the winds
as black holes open for devouring
universal chaos in the realm of time
surface of earth  covered in rime
from beyond enter the horror
of a dark and hideous nature
the fall of man is now at hand
awakened from an ancient slumber
the immortal ones return
the earth is theirs once again
stricken, cursed  frozen damnation
man's fall to perpetual domination
time trapped in between changes
frigid return to the chamber of ages
sunset, expect
this to be your last with our vast return
as death is set
at three sixes where hillbeacons burn
darkness, undress
your descending skirts yield a thirsting altar
bloodred, yet still unfed
lips distend ending, time to falter
welcome arms wide and crucified
the slaughter
lightening freezes seven
outtakes from the rape of the world
sins expelled from heaven
now befoul from the bowels of hell
where the tragic in theory and practice fell
last prayers, hang in the air
each unto their own rag and bone meal saviors
strung where crippled vultures dare
golgotha
coughs another cross to grave god's failure
once the forests spired
nurtured in nature'heart
now dreat cedars feed the pyres
needfires lit for greater harm
as her children toy with razors
sightless and deeply scarred
and the moon arose to phase her
cracks a grin so wide it hides the stars
and lights our path
back through the shattered glass
we come like drumming thunder
tides enwreathed in scum and plunder
krakenteethed to tear asunder
all those too blind to see
where the tragic in theory and practice meet
deranged, uncaged
we rage like a plague through this age of greed
sowers of discord, growing wars to reap
a terrible crop to beat a vicious retreat
scorched earth, rebirth
disinterred in the writhe of the lone survivor
whose worth is worse than the curse
of sardonicus choking on his own saliva
who shares the last laugh now
dead wedded fates fulfill their vows?
foot in mouth of sacred cows
face down in dust and poisoned ground
"archangel, dark angel
lend me thy light
through death's veil
till we have heaven in sight!"
"archangel, dark angel
lend me thy light
through death's veil
till we have heaven in sight!"
"archangel, dark angel
lend me thy light
through death's veil
till we have heaven in sight!"
"archangel, dark angel
lend me thy light
through death's veil
till we have heaven in sight!"
"archangel, dark angel
lend me thy light
through death's veil
till we have heaven in sight!"
"archangel, dark angel
lend me thy light
through death's veil
till we have heaven in sight!"
"archangel, dark angel
lend me thy light
through death's veil
till we have heaven in sight!"
"archangel, dark angel
lend me thy light
sibilant and macabre
walpurgis sauntered in
skies litten with fivepointed stars
the work of crafts surpassing sin
as she graced her window ledge
an orphaned gypsy nymph
this issue of the forest's bed
skin flushed with sipped absinthe
her eyes revealed, as brocken's peak
tried once concealing hell
a snow white line of divine freaks
in riot, where they fell
the circus lurches in, a ring of promised delight
for seven days and seven festival nights
what wicked wonders lie within the confines
of the panther's den
she watches from a maypole, on the rip of her tongue
the restless spirit of christmas to come
a gretel sick of merely sucking her thumb
than gingerbread men
spawned scorned, abhorred by the aerial
she was the light of the world going down
wartorn, forlorn and malarial
she was found
born in a burial gown
unloosed, the chain of her godgiven cross
seduced, now pagan ribbons swathe her repose
in a carnival of souls sold and similarly lost
too many decades misfit and mislaid
in innocence, a tender legend of prey
parades her second coming, now they're running afraid
spawned scorned, abhorred by the aerial
she was the light of the world going down
wartorn, forlorn and malarial
she was found
born in a burial gown
now she moves with a predator's guile
beyond the fire lit circle of life
she soothes your cold heart for a while
then matches its beat, syncing in with a knife
she wrestles her dreams with a delicate case
espied by her cross on the wall
and should she awake, through embrace or mistake
she would take jesus
bless foot forward and all
sibilant and at last
the circus crawled away
with another lover in its arms
dancing on her grave
to and fro, through freeze and thaws
from zenith to nadir
the universal tug of war
saw lines drawn in the sands appear
divisions of a promised land
and hell for those that dwelt
beneath a pharaoh's granite hand
where death wed something else
millennia swam passed
since the covened ark
ran aground on ararat...
but anew, tempered shadows grew
out of midian, strewing fear
over verdant lawns, the resurgent storms
led a desert son to sear
from the palace orchard i espied...
where swooning trees and moonless beams vied
for the painted eye of the royal bride
whose gliding curves were deified
...beyond her grace where love would die
wretched destiny arrive
back and forth the prophet came
riddled with a tongue of plagues
that would render might egypt lame
if the rage of god stayed unassuaged...
i listened with a heavy heart
but unveiled to the threats
this hebrew in a jackal's mask
would dredge into effect
thenceforth the nile reddened
s if set stretched his hand
to beset the damned
and bruised with flies
the skies grew leadened
but these miracles, feared
were all but reared
by nature, whose law alone
stood that revered
this hysteria passed, but still the mark
of yahveh burned on in the dark
one final time, on the steps to the shrine
of thoth, i twined with fate
"let my people go"
"still my word is no"
"then death shall be the deciding plague"
since the crimes divine i left behind
i'd warred with every tribe that plied
in holy vestament, but with time
bored sore of clawing what was mine
i laid my bones and made my throne
with a view to paradise
thenceforth the heavens deafened
as if great beasts
were unleashed to feast on man
and with carrion span
michael was weaponed
to descend with scorn
a dark reform
through piramses
skinning mine and her firstborn
thus suspiria passed each sacred mark
of yahveh, bleeding in the dark
with nauseous dawn, a cry, forlorn
unified from plazas deep
the prophet's curse
far worse had worked
to wrest the war in me from sleep
drowned in light, a downward light
bathed the snaking exodus
through the wilderness
as the aeons crept
impressed with fresh bloodlust
midwinter wrongs the rites of spring
her spinal chill rakes the earth
whilst pensive souls at zero sing
woebetidings of rebirth
under cold stares of mars maligned
nearsuicides cross their hearts
and unborns writhe in tepid brine
for something wicked this way starts
beneath the howling stars
elizabeth, paragon of vice
watches the sun set pyres alight
as bane and tyranny, her dobermans sleep
like spellbound paramours at her feet
a chatter of bells without
raise hellhounds, teeth on edge
from sleighs hastened through snow lit red
guests espied from the garret ledge
great gloomy mirror tell her face
she will outblind them all
that heavenly bodies would fall from grace
to possess such a lustrous pall
for beauty is always cruel
for beauty is always
let destiny in chains commence
damnation under gods seeking recompense
enslaving to the whims of this mistress
as the dance ensued
elizabeth's mood
tempered by the craft of a vitreous moon
in slick black iciness it grew
to consume
the wench her tower tombed
tending to her costume
bore the brunt of the storm
when the needle askewed
she has her dogs maul the bitch's wrists through
restored to jaded bliss
this evisceratrix
descended to the ball
with painted blood upon her lips
passing like a comet so white
as to eclipse
the waltz wound down, transfixed
devoid of all breath in the air
even death paled to compare
to the taint of her splendour
so rare and engendered
'pon the awed throng gathered
there
beneath the howling stars
she danced so macabre
men entranced divined from her gait
that this angel stepped from a pedestal
had won remission from fate
by alighting to darker spheres
delighting in held sway
for she was not unlike the goddess
to whom the wolves bayed
"whilst envy glanced daggers
from court maidens, arboured
who whispered in sects
of suspicions abroad
that elizabeth bewitched
see how even now the whore casts
her spells upon the black count
whom her reddened lips hold fast"
tongue unto tongue
swept on tides without care
for the harpies who rallied
their maledict glares
a halo of ravens tousled her hair
chandeliers a tiara
for passions ensnared
"phantasies sexed
when their eyes, moonstruck met
their friction wore a way
through the sea of foreplay
lovers at first bite
she an eve tempted to lay
gasping at rafters
flesh pressed in ballet"
but caprice, honours leashed
she absconded the feast
to prowl wonderland
beasts in hand from the keep
of feudal dilemma
well mantled in furs
through cullis to watch
dogstars howl at the earth
on this violent night
unholy night
winds lashed their limbs together
as the ether vent its wintry spite
she wished his kiss on her frozen landscapes
to excite the bleak advance
from castle bowers
wherein small hours
the devil never came by chance
a lone charm tied to her inner thigh
sent lusts nova as hooves trod
cobbled streets where lowlives fleet
were flung to a wayward god
midwinter wrongs the rites of spring
her spinal chill rakes the earth
whilst pensive souls at zero sing
woebetidings of rebirth
under cold stares of mars maligned
nearsuicides cross their hearts
and unborns writhe in tepid brine
for something wicked this way starts
beneath the howling stars
pounding upon the pauper ridge
earshot of a hunched beldame
elizabeth teased, would he dare to please
such elderly loins enflamed?
to this he feigned a grim disdain
playing to her slayful eye
but the hag replied
"this girl that chides
will soon be as plagued with age as i"
her consort laughed a plume of icy breath
for elizabeth's grace could raise
a flag of truce in burning heaven
or the dead from early graves
yet still she seethed
this proud snow queen
embittered with the cursed retort
and because he sought her loves onslaught
he gutted the crone for sport
soon in full moon fever they were wed
lycanthropic in the conjugal bed
littered with aphrodisiacs
to tease dynastic union
and beget them further maniacs
elizabeth
free reigned, now a countess
outwielded and outwore
her title like a favoured dress
whilst her errant lord
whose seasons savoured war
stormed black to fell the infidel
her embers, tempered, roared.
one might see in mina
my disease
but it is she who has infected me
for all eternity...
as the sun slips the tearaway stars
into the scented scheme of night
i kissed her mouth like a dark red rose
set upon a marbled dream of white
so pure of thought like a vestal statue
jewelled with a godlent grace
i was close to coming when she bid adieu
fuelled by the heartache rent upon her face there
oh mina, obscener
thoughts obsess my days
oh mina, obscener
thoughts possess me
that i must now obey
they say the darkest hour
is that before the dawn
when nothing in one's power
can dissipate the great forlorn
shadows of fire that haunt me
like risen whispers of her name
for dawn is a dusk
wherein needs must
erupt from the grave, aflame
written in the dead of night
and riding on the burning wind
smitten by her read delight
my words alight like leaves of sin
stepping through a mirror
the princess of the emerald glass
brought me one step nearer
love's infernal past...
they say hell hath no furies
like a woman scorned by life
when the heavenly judge and juries
participate to chain this wife
with forced virtues, her secret needs
drew on my foreign blood
on warm wet nights, with stormwracked bites
i gave her eden after the flood
written in the dead of night
and riding on the burning wind
smitten by her red delight
my words alight like leaves of sin
verona, marishka, aleera
brides of old and goddesses all
forgive my wishes to be always near her
forever or whenever seas recall
this aphrodite from my embrace
for as mars whom her lips placate
i tore these shores with wars of hatred
before our paris set his fate
in helen, one might find mistake
in winning tragedy
for all eternity...
i am still lovesick for mina
i am still so lovesick for her
an archangel in bondage
bediademed, souled
with a murder of ravens
but no less astarte to behold
abandoned by heaven
to the dead, dark and past
cast her dispersions
on life's brittle glass
and though her eyes still held fire
as stonewalls caged the beast
'gainst the lassitudes of death
she fought but fell to greet
and midst lies in collusion
she was martyred to teach
that divinity and lust
are forever forbidden to meet
but i swore that they would
before the veil could part our embrace
twixt her cold, silent hips, i kissed
and promised christendom in flames
gravid with madness
like a feculent dirge
that obsesses the heart
i am convened by words
to avenge her ebon splendor and surrender
my soul to the dead to achieve
prophecies of libidinous scourge
horripilation braying over carious herds
vexing nightmares
and their weak prayers
to a no one there
to hinder her decree
to weed the world of their disease
as shadows unblind mine eyes to see
the meat that is their congregation
how they plead to the skies
but this is mere foreplay to war
scarriddled saffron eves bleed like the conjugal
vestal daughters giving throat to the priest
a psychophant, the despoiler of faith
now his skinless crucifixion feeds a winged diocese
for her interred
i tore a battle banner from his hide
splashed in red goetia
hues of hell and deicide
so came the night
its obsidian light
is a master whom disasters
suck upon like concubines
and under black skirts
that whisper of delight
dark seeds near fruition
darked deeds to marry mine
in death's bed, i have lain
paying lipservice to shame
but for dreaming of thee, i regain
a reason to seek life again
then we smite the divine
for our true nature is sin
to strip tender flesh from these swine
like the lick of carnivorous winds
the breath of the storm that begins
by forcing its herod tongue in
the womb of the holy virgin
to taste of immaculate sin
from temptation's peak, we will see
the world unfurled at last
now the wolves of time who stalk mankind
shall be as one in grim repast
commemorating sickle moons
the pack are poised to reap
a scythe of white roses in bloom
whose twisted thorns will keep
a crown upon a dead man
daylights crucified in sleep
and lives that hide in scriptured lies
to the memories of a scream
and we shall dance amid the ruin
as adam and evil
dizzy at the falling stars
that burn fiercer in throes of upheaval
if all must we damn for this moment
then it shall be so
for our souls have crossed oceans of time
to clasp one another more tightly
than death could alone
as zyklon beats reign to make carrion crawl
the talons of lust rake a clarion call
to the lick of carnivorous winds
to the lick of carnivorous winds
gravid with madness
like a feculent dirge
that obsesses the heart
i am convened by words
to avenge her ebon splendor and surrender
my soul to the dead to achieve
prophecies of libidinous scourge
horripilation braying over carious herds
vexing nightmares
and their weak prayers
to a no one there
to hinder her decree
to weed the world of their disease
as shadows unblind mine eyes to see
the meat that is their congregation
incomprehensible
in the beginning
rimmed with wind and storm
a great black wrath of infinite math
spat snarling into form
and there was heaven
lit up with precious stones
each one could fall but for the rule
of faith and love and stronger thrones
and therein rose vast wonders
affections to be seen
fathered from the plundered
reflections of a dream
fogging into nightmare
for him whose place was set
with wayward stars that absent, marred
all creation with their
in the beginning
bewinged and ringed with dawn
this favoured avatar, enthralled
swansongs from those that thronged this shore
with gabriel and michael
he shone with fierce intent
for loyalty, their joy to see
him spur the hymns to heaven
from the sculptured lips of seraphim
whom fate then cruelly rent
wtih sleightfingered strains of harmony
each note to grim portent
as grinnning nimbus gathered
over spires arabesque
for him that blazed with holy praise
that for a jealous god was meant
shining feriluce
lustrous scourge of fallen spirits
basked in glory, flew
to lakes in sacred altitudes
sweet haunting music swathed the breeze
with curling tongues that lapped his lead
as through thick mountain mist
he wandered cursed with thoughts adrift
he paused to draught forbidden streams
that whispered siren promises
to drown his thirst
for sports amiss
these waters held secrets
liked raped russian dolls
wherein evil and good
tore his soul for control
and drunk with the verse of desire's first words
the weight of the universe
slunk in rehearsed
horror in numbers too great to discern
the rotting of worlds to the conqueror worm
and love a rare orchid so fragile in bloom
espied gasping breath under darksheeted moons
shining feriluce
reflected in a jaded mirror
climbing from the noose
of time in divine servitude
and thus a strange new melody
of will and wanton fantasies
whetted by the veiled, seen
danced from his ashen lips
in red dawn scores, the silver scream
of truth and her deleted scenes
was taken up as far it seemed
as god his words eclipsed
those waters hid visions
like butchers in war
perverting the course
of life's blood evermore
in the beginning
skinned well with gibbous tones
of countenance and ignorance
in equal measures sewn
a marbled arc of angels
sworn to the morning star
shared his pride and deep inside
felt chill shadows sweep their cards
turn the lights down low
and bolt the door up
future is coming
future rising up
whoa
shotgun blast, a demon piece of lead
with both eyes open
i wait up for the kill
feel the evil
feel the heat as i blast you open
death comes ripping
and it's going, death comes ripping
you feel the heat as death comes ripping
rip your back out
and death comes ripping out
flesh and blood
too weak for you
turning it over
a little too late to penetrate
death comes ripping
and it's going, death comes ripping
you feel the heat as death comes ripping
rip your back out
death comes ripping
and it's going, death comes ripping
you feel the heat as death comes ripping
rip your back out
death comes ripping
and i know that death comes ripping out
whoa
whoa
whoa
whoa
candelabra snuffed prey  silhouette wedded
nightfall take my hand
seduce me with silky timbred limbs
grant me thy dark command
over the peaks framing tapestries
of thick forest, dusk has filled
with lucifugous kisses enwreathed in mist
creeping like violations from the shadows
to kill
lucretia
is my love in vein
when thy tears bleed sweeter
thank the midsummer rain?
bewinged, infested belfries
toll o'er the sobbing throng
a writhe of lethargic, terrored nudes
whipped and welted neath the barbed windsong
in saddean paradise
ancestral legacies linger on
i am he
the crowned and conquering darkness
satan robed in ecumenical filth
livid bacchus sustained by bridal echelons of sylph
this wintry eve when the snow glistens deep
and sharpened turrets wed the jewelless skies
i shrug off the shroud of preternatural sleep
enbroided by these words malaresia scribed....
"beauty slept and angels wept
for her immortal soul
in this response, all evil chose
to claim her for their very own"
carpathia
the pleasured dead speak of her
in necromantic tongue
when ambered daylights are done
masterbating in their graves
on her zenith to come
this catafalque night when awed stars report
their absence from the heavenly brow
crippled seraph shalt cower in illustrious courts
whilsts the cloaked maelstrom resounds throughout
"how the storm it fulfills
my heart though unhealed
celestial knives ebonied
and wild woods thrill
yet far fiercer still
her lustre eviscerates me"
carpathia
priapic lovers twist in concert with her
covenants are struck, jagged lightning fellates
the path towards the castle weary innocence takes
i rule as master here
where feral hordes impart my temper
love sank wounded when i, betrayed
saw death etch cruelly, upon my lineage
"usher the spite seething draconist
and commit this world to thy ancient
sovereignty"
erunescent veil descend
psalmed sunset thus portends
and laid to rest, i now am blessed
with this darkness, forever more
supreme vampiric evil
instrumental
reigning at the feast of phantasia
heightened pleasures were endeavoured to bow
before my coronation and vocal aspirations
to rule this fool creation fallen 'neath me now
i knew deep eyes
of a distant christ
were scarred from afar under starry lustre
sighting my recitals on the rites of vice
perverting virtue
enslaving grace
behind the glittering mask of pride
saving face finding thorns to pierce his side
desire, the fire
spread hell throughout my soul
and higher the wire
the more i sought control
straining from the leash in exultation
head to the wind to breathe with ravenous lungs
the global scent of fornication
a writhe of many vipers deciphering tongues
i whispered schemes to dreamers then
to pursue an eden
that screamed of me supreme again
as my world bloomed
so too the moon
through adam to seth, enos, cainan
mahalaleel and jared blew
perverting virtue
enslaving grace
behind the slippery guise of lies
saving face making waves to drown their faith
messiahs, pariahs
aeons reversed the two
this higher, their spires
the more cursed grew their roots
and suffering...
i swept cruel seas
on the galley of the shadow of death
a fist in the cunt of the spread horizon
a kiss for the sun risen red once dines on
the coast of menses
discharged from celestial wombs
a first degree murder of ravens
followed in fugue through the crack of doom
the goat of mendes
i set regime
in the galley of the shadow of death...
angels in raiments
as pure as coal
taking their payments
in tortured mortal souls
a bold direction
the abyss edge
but on cold reflection
one they warmed to nonetheless
as they preyed the paths of the righteous
through the myth of thistled orchard floors
bearing gifts of plenitude, for
the apples of the lord were rotten to the core
temptation, my ambassador
attila, hesiod, pharisees and nero
all begged of me for more
down dark steps of history
i waged war with a heaven
i could not see...
beyond my wildest fantasies
throwing sixes over deadly sin
i traded whose who played to win
skin for precious kin...
and that that wormed within
staining the reams of revelation
etching everafters in accursed verse
the limpid rags of resurrection
from papal parapets were to dirt dispersed
desire, the flyers
spread hell throughout their souls
and higher the fire
the more i held control
thee i invoke, born less one
all woman, pure predator
where in conspiracy and impulse dwell
like a seething fall from grace
thee i worship
thou art darkest gabrielle
no church shall bar our path
seductive evil drink your fill
of the bleeding christ in your arms
you are in my dreams
the darkness in my eyes
the rapture in my screams
black goddess arise
nothing will keep us apart
we could kill them all
if our desire tore free
our union is one, sweet, sinful eve
and the night draws in beside her
as we embrace the dark side by side
i pour my soul to those eyes full of fire
to harvest the seed ploughed inside her
archangel, snare the flesh
suck dry the ebbing wound
leave them lifeless and broken
my beloved
oh, how i craved for you
you so pure and otherworldly
with your scent of winter
am i to bleed myself dry to see your delight?
and the fear retreats forever
come to me black goddess arise
when my secrets are buried in thine
come to me black goddess arise
under seven stars we came together
come to me black goddess arise
to plot the new age's decline
come to me, arise
ishtar my queen come forth to me
and help me seize my future from the house of death
that in the release of immortality
i should slay their fucking nazarene
ah the lies the jew, i kill for you
hidden lusts will break the gates and swarm
as love secretes the thrill for war
the virgin raped shall seek to whore
shewolf bare your snarling jaw
crawl in awful stealth to me
forever a voyeur i've been
nocturnal goddess of the moon
so she comes, unseen
thus uzza and azel speak
the burning seed, is thrust in eve
and yearning keeps me, captive of desire
make me as a flower that grows
forever in your throne
that i might pollinate the world
with darkness as your own
embrace me in spellbinding eyes
the fire of life that never dies
tear deeper through my paper wounds
and never leave inside
love shall consume and bathe the lady
whom i worship and ride therefore
she will greet me as a serpent
in her dark, secret eden
and i will always want
for her witchcraft is
desire... desire...
my soul is poisoned from within...
i crawl with languid guilt to thee
forever flushed in sin
lamia, latria i give
my soul is poisoned from within
wisdom breeds, fecundity
and her cunt she feeds, to fulfill her desire
to eve i cum...
sevenfold my passion wrought
to ransack eden, and to taste the whore
i cling beyond her sabled court
she is a gateway, to that darkness lost
now dream...
oh, the fevered need for her
when greed and lust are sharpened in that one desire
that allconsuming fire
reveal to me your mysteries, witch
the tree is plundered but i have the see
to be sown in thee
"mon sortilege a ete le pouvoir qui diovent
avoir les ames fortes sur les espirits faibles"
leonora galigai
existing on damnation's edge
the priest had never known
to witness such a violent show
of power overthrown
angels fighting aimlessly
still dying by the sword
our legions killing all in sight
to get the one called lord
the gates of hell lie waiting as you see
there's no price to pay just follow me
i can take your lost soul from the grave
jesus knows your soul can not be saved
crucify the so called lord
he soon shall fall to me
your souls are damned your god has fell
to slave for me eternally
hell awaits
the reaper guard's the darkened gates
that satan calls his home
demons feed the furnace where
the dead are free to roam
lonely children of the night
there's seven ways to go
each leading to the burning hole
that lucifer controls
priests of hades seek the sacred star
satan sees the answer lies not far
zombies screaming souls cry out to you
satanic laws prevail your life is through
pray to the moon when it is round
death with you shall then abound
what you seek for can't be found
in sea or sky or underground
now i have you deep inside my everlasting grasp
the seven bloody gates of hell
is where you'll live your last
warriors from hell's domain
will bring you to your death
the flames of hades burning strong
your soul shall never rest
the gates of hell lie waiting as you see
there's no price to pay just follow me
i can take your lost soul from the grave
jesus knows your soul can not be saved
sacrifice the lives of all i know they
soon shall die
their souls are damned to rot in hell
and keep the fire growing deep inside
hell awaits
hosannas in extremis
invading tempestuous skies
when inanna rose, bringing angels repose
and narcissus' fate as their prize
blinded by diana's mirror
wherein coffined truth struggles, forlorn
and covetous stars out their eyes to deceive
the horrors performed on her shores
as jewelled ishtar, in darker aeons
trespassed ereshkigal's grasp
her ravening twin, wreathed in whispers and wind
now inspires catharsis to dance
through the weave of white vaults
where the shadows revolt
at the incest of spiritual love
castrata choirs, bereft of such lusts
spatter virginal breasts with their blood
the iron tongue of midnight hath told twelwe
thirstridden wolves serenade a moon
who seems no mistress of herself
and heavens pour forth vast casualties
thy host given up for me
thou which wert once and then ceased to be
art now ensconced to chapters
of a lengthening tragedy
whilst we scream free
deep forests impale the sinister mist
their sorcery taught to the clouds
who muster like mountains, a fountainous wish
to vex the sweet dead from silk odious shrouds
stormwoken sisters of judas unfurl
as psyche to sapphic lament
wrapt in thy tresses and taloned caresses
whisper me secrets beheld beyond death
'desires
i was loath to lose
to the virginbloodied priests
whose lord fantasied on magdalene
and sought to savour her as beast
her aching sex
a rose undone
as mine in tears and spasms wrung'
ebon nemesis, slain jericho's stone
has built thee a marbled stair
by candlelight to eden and a serpentine throne
where ravens rape the tenanting angels there
hurry, else death may spy us here
and quicken the pulse of dawn
embering flames writhe to life again
the starry brow threshed with poisonous thorn
huntress, draw back the silvered bow
thy dogs set upon the manger
the enemy in throes...
whilst drifting fogs devour
all hallows witching hour
on this long, dark seance for the soul
through malevolent scylla, charybdis graves
our conquesting spirits pour forth, unassuaged
occultnesses watch us and seraph, afraid
like fireflies plunge to her maw, midst crashing black waves
'remember with pride what thou art
lest we forget in awe of our terrible past'
when dark royalties drank of despair
idols hewed down 'neath a desert god's stare
in thrall to revenges sworn there
what dreams could we father, when farther we fell
to nightmare... ?
'well versed in misery
we have lain naked in darkest ravines
now the sun has set in slumber. we delight
like serpents in arousal
coiled to strike at the light'
now abyssed lucifers master the earth
uncloister jaded harlots once served
enthralled by cruel raptures, rehearsed
kiss slumbered beauty and weapon our thousand year curse
the laughter of khaos
gatekeepers flee the onslaught
a world enslaved to flame
bondage in phallustine
pleasure temples for my bride
nubian grace swiftly seize
thieves blooddivine
empires thrive on sacrifice
"oh, sweet midian
i burn for thee at heart
don't despair me
come bare me on wings of graveyard robbed leather
to where pleasure rings deep secrets
in spurts after dark"
under full moons waxing lyrically
death's poetry floods the soul
like the freezing seed of a demon freed
to curse the stars with vertigo
and in their dance, in trance i've prised wide
slick rifts twixt obsidian thighs
hymeneal gates to darker sides
a glimpse of plinths where midian lies
midian
haunted by this portent
this obsession in my mind
with a city sunk below
tall cedar groves and graves sublime
sporting their importance
marble wings spread to the skies
a vale of dreams that it would seem
the daylights race to leave behind
these visions struck like a furious fuck
nailing wet lips to cold cemetery walls
flashes of lust to dust
splashed across my psychic pall
as hybrid lovers reached their cusp
with final thrusts i saw it all
forbidden midian
a long fabled judecca
a sanctuary for sin
to rival heaven
free of eden's tragic wreck
though the only angels in repose
were those with ivy strangled necks
small mercies in vistas of dolmen and vault
gaunt, haunched edifices
midst lightfingered mists
from whence more awful shadows
drew back rusted bolts
and dared a threshold
the searing sun had knelt to kiss
shades of dusk, cruelty and myth
the tribes of christ will not forgive
and shall not suffer their kind to live
for i, mesmerized, started not from tombs
or their waltz so sibilant
through the gathering gloom
but from flumes of the moon in bloom
baring cach a face effaced
and raped in the womb
in hidden midian
a vatican lying in state
for the sanctity of sin
to rival heaven
above eden's birth defects
though the only angels that arose
were those who fell to most requests
small mercies in vistas where dolmen and vault
caught twisted whispers where fisted sisters
haunched, flaunted orifice
midst lighter fingered mists
whilst i watched without revolt
carnalities few beasts permit
between the dog and wolf
bared fangs met in intercourse
a nightly right of teeth and cunt
for those below who rose to hunt
sor sights that preyed on me for days
and in laudenum's haze
i painted them all
the slew of sith and kin
i drew in blood, my veins in thrall
to deathugees at peace within
an underworld free of mortal rule
crotesques and wolves in women's skins
the raven winged and missing limbed
suicides and split thighed seraphim
and marble stairs
star grazers dare
ascend like prayer
as smoke or ghost or lithe nightmares
under full moons waxing lyrically
death's poetry floods the soul
like the wrecking weed of a demon freed
to curse the star with vertigo
and in their dance, in trance i praise wide
slick rifts twixt obsidian thighs
hymeneal gates to other sides
a labyrinth wherein midian hides
midian
i know i've seen
through the black backed mirrors in sanity
lucent prides amassed in last retreat
prurient souls but no more freaks
than those leashing dreams at harm's length from me
and just like grim ascension prophecies
my revenge, carved deep, will be
a grisly plot that reads
like my filthy white ward spattered with their screams
when my deviliverers come from fog for me
exhuming the moon
through the bars in my room
the sooner the bitter pills swallowed are through
but no aphrodites, genotypes, demonarchetypes,
no cenobites rise to clame me from you
no! no! no!
don't leave here in this storm weathered cell
no! no! no!
with prophets and losses
and dead men from crosses
my fate is a preview of derelict hell
"and the earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep..."
one dark afternoon like a shadow i flew
through the rain that fell sick with lament
to this house of incest for when we undressed
blasphemies against venus were rent
though her sister removed, her wet body approved
the parade of my heavenly quests
yet all tongues are not true, some are forked or askew
like an uncivil serpent's at best
for oustered from eden i fausted all reason
hook in mouth like saint peter pan
to haunt faery groves and hot virgin coves
wherein the promiscuous swam
i elected lovers and rejected others
mephistresses that don't give a damn...
but in those that still do my deep interest grew
the rise of the true pentagram!
evening minuetto in a castle by the sea
a jewel more radiant than the moon
lowered her mask to me
the sublimest creature the gods, full of fire
would marvel at making their queen
infusing the air with her fragrant desire
and my heart reeled with grave poetry
from grace i fell in love with her
scent and feline lure
and jade woodland eyes that ushered in the impurest
"erotic, laden fantasies amid this warm autumn night
she lulled me away from the rich masquerade
and together we clung in the bloodletting moonlight"
pearled luna, what spell didst thou cast on me?
her icy kiss fervoured my neck
like whispering waves 'pon acheron's beach
in a whirl of sweet voices and statues
that phantomed the dying trees
this debauched seductress in black, took me
in a pale azured dawn like ligeia reborn
i tore free of my sleep  sepulchre
on the sea misted lawn where stone figures, forlorn
lamented the spectre of her
bewildered and weak, yet with passion replete
i hungered for past overtures
the curse of unrest and her ardent caress
came much more than my soul could endure
i, at once endeavoured to see her again
stirring from midnight's inertia
knowing not even her name
on a thin precipice over carnal abyss
i danced like a blind acolyte
drunk on red wine, her dead lips on mine
suffused with the perfume of night
for hours i scoured the surrounding grounds
in vain that we might meet
when storm clouds broke, ashened, fatigued
i sought refuge in a cemeterty
sleep, usher dreams
taint to nightmares from a sunless nether
mistress of the dark
i now know what thou art
screams haunt my sleep
dragged from nightmares thou hast wed together
lamia and lemures
spawned thee leche
to snare my flesh
portrait of the dead countess
deep stained pain that i had dreamt
flaunted demise, life's punishment
leaving little strength to seal this wretched tomb
but poised nectar within my stirs
up feverous desire and morbid purpose to search
through cobwebbed drapery to where she swoons
goddess of the graveyard, of the tempest and moon
in flawless fatal beauty her very visage compels
glimpses of a heaven where ghost companies fell
to mourning the loss of god in blackest velvet
enrobed in their downfall like a swift silhouette
"fleeting, enshadowed
thou art privy to my sin
secrets dead, wouldst thou inflict
the cruel daylights upon my skin?
dost thou not want to worship me
with crimson sacrifice
so my cunt may twitch against thy kiss
and weep with newfound life?"
red roses for the devil's whore
dark angels taste my tears
and whisper haunting requiems
softly to mine ear
needfires have lured abominations here
nocturnal pulse
my veins spill forth their waters
rent by lips i cherish most
awash on her perfidious shores
where drowning umbra o'er the stars
ebon's graves where lovers whore
like seraphim and nahemah
"nahemah"
pluck out mine eyes, hasten, attest
blind reason against thee, enchantress
for i must know, art thou not death?
my heart echoes bloodless and incensed
doth temptation prowl night in vulvic revelry
did not the queen of heaven come as devil to me?
on that fatal hallow's eve when we fled company
as the music swept around us in the crisp, fated leaves
under horned diana where her bloodline was sewn
in a graveyard of angels rent in cool marbled stone
i am grieving the loss of life in sombre velvet
enrobed in death's shadow like a swifter
silhouette
this is the end of everything
rear the tragedies
that the seraphim shall sing
hear me now!
oh crime she be treasure revail will be pleasure somehow
maleficent in dusky rose
gathered satin lapped her breasts
like blood upon the snow
a tourniquet of topaz
glistened at her throat
awakening, pulled from the tomb
her spirit freed eclipsed the moon
that she outshone as a fallen star
a regal ornament from a far flung nebular
her likeness hung in the black gallery
commanding unease
demanding of death to breathe
midst the whirl and daylight fauna
of society at court
elizabeth bedazzled, her presence sought applause
though her torchlit shadow
thrown upon damp cellar walls
greeted nothing but despair from slaves her nights enthralled
thirteen winter solstices had shown
her path, that the dark
had marked its dominion
spaying the confessor
whose caresses she'd known,
as whipcord in the house of dog
her cold cunt meat on holy bone
raped of faith, she now embraced
the narcissistic unrest frozen on the mirror's face
with this disdain, inside these veins
highborn wanton that she was
she sought to keep what age would claim
her soul was sold and for this toll
reeking pyres ever smouldered
on the whims of one so in control
elizabeth, mysterious
cruelty brought thee orchids
from the bowels of the abyss
once upon atrocity when midwitches stifled cries
and carved abortive runes in reddened wombs
exhumed by crying eyes
madness came upon
her like an amorous lover's seed
lifeblood splashed upon her skin
in gout torture unleashed
and to her dead reflection
twas as if her pallor gleamed
like an angel's warmed by candles
where erotic stains had cleaved
so demons dragged this libertine
lusts screaming for release
upon the flesh of maidens preened
as canvas for caprice
exacting obeisance
her gaze held a seance
of spirits too trapped under glass to commune
a sleetier mistress than luna
whose threats to consume her
met with torments giving vent to her swoon
flat on her back
packprey for the reams
of verses and curses
that haunted her dreams
midnightmare chimed
thirteen in her mind
a disciple of scars
branded years hissed behind
ridden splitthighed
by the father of lies
an ovation of wolves
blushed the skies as they writhed
but heaven is never forever
she came, a spent storm
from the clouds
leaving serpents in office
inside every gate
to lick righteous holes
blinding lords to the fate
of virgins forced naked
to defile on rent knees
hacked and racked backwards
menses choking their pleas
more whore more
twitching make me wet with thee
carcass rub me raw
led to other worlds
by the girls she curled within
i took their skins to see her
be my mannequin
be my mannequin
i cannot remember
how it was that we first met
curve of moon and haunted shore
the stars were not those heaven sent
did we come together
at masked palatial balls
in silks and flesh and leather
or did we come at all?
i dreamt a midnight castle
the eerie song of wolves
and eyes that danced with fire
as they have forever more
our rites of sin
have long fathered a hymn
to burden him
whom by slip of after whim
at genesis
dressed her like the wind
in autumn gowns
that pinned her down
to be my mannequin
be my mannequin
always poised on winter
but never would she break
my lovecraft and black witch heart
that pounded in her wake
we kissed on distant balconies
a law unto her own
thirteenth dark commandment
of figures pressed to stone
turning cream with fantasies
that god alone would know
we graced vomitorium
with the sweet excess of rome
flagrant in the past
our names were deeply carved on the tree of life in long dead languages
led to other worlds
by the girls she curled within
i took their skins to see her
be my mannequin
be my mannequin
i tongued the nuns at louviers
but not one word possessed
her divine right, an archetype
for mortal goddesses...
her bouquets are wilted
too long has she slept
their cruel red mouths darkened
to bowed silhouettes
i saw in a new moon
with her scent on my breath
but then all to soon
came the hunger for flesh
i held her in eyes like necropoli
laying her on a tomb with a view
lighting her from her feet
to the stars in her hair
drove sweet blood to her throat
and my lips parted there
in the tone of splintered bone
she screams benighted
my limbs ignite
a carneal carnivore
on all fours to go...
an ebon nemesis
from torture gardens of dis
having never breathed an eve
as far narcotic as this
two spellbound hellhounds
hearts pounding loud
racing heaven out of focus
under quicksilver clouds
"god is maimed come let us prey..."
to lunar deities that pave deadways
twixt the living and the grave
amor e morte
to cast our fearl shadows there
we made love bleed on a deathbed shared
where, begging me to feed
to best be were...
i licked her wounds and ate her rare
argentinum spurred
her watnon words incurred
a sin ridden tongue
to open trading in fur
never were those gates of pearl
so rubbed to their cusp
never were the worlds above
so bitten with the bestial...
seraphim fell like guillotines
giving gracious head
instead of harking prophecies
and how our brother sang
amor e morte
in the thick evergreens
theirs was a chorus for raucous souls
shifting shape and lifting napes
to commemorate
erotic stains
amor e morte
unfasten thy masque
come skyclad to my arms
leave thy gown a dark pool at thy feet
i yearn musky valleys that no man hath seen
the chill keen of stars
over yew and deep wooded ravines
a hidden meridian
where midian may be...
in black antlered glades
encunted in this forest goddess
she whispers my name
i buck under flames
animal nitrates
howling through my veins
i ride riptides that wrest and writhe to the fore
new lusts ecllipsing lips
that brought me to this verge of war
with inner beasts unleashed
to feast, fuck and run
rampart in chase of she wolf pacts
forged on heat with setting suns
i love the night
it would murder my soul
should i ever fall blind
for though thy flesh haunts
i keep also in mind
the stampede of clouds
from dusk's predatory sky
purple versed like the funeral hearse
that first turned thee over to my...
unbridled kiss when i found thee in mist
dressed for the sepulchre
my demon bride...
"god is maimed come let us prey..."
to lunar deities that pave deadways
twixt the living and the grave
amor e morte
ours was a chorus for raucous souls
shifting sape and lifting nape
to commemorate
erotic stains
amor e morte
amor e morte
spatter the stars
douse their luminosity
with our amniotic retch
promulgating the birth
of another hell on earth
shadows gather poisoned henna for the flesh
a necrotic cattle brand
the hissing downfall pentagram
carven deep upon the church doors of the damned
but no passover is planned
a great renewal growls at hand
and only when they're running
will they come to understand
so ends the pitiful reign of man
when the moon exhales
behind a veil
of widowhood and clouds
on a biblical scale
we raise the stakes
to silhouette the impaled
crowds
within this kissed disembowel arena
a broken seal on an ancient curse
unleashes beasts from the seismic breach
with lightning reach and genocidal thirst
mountains of archaos theories
in collision as at planetary dawn
apocalypse's razorbacks
beat wings on glass as thunder cracks
unfurled across a world hurled to the black
cthulhu dawn
shatter the glass house
wherein spirits breathe out
halitosis of the soul
from a recking abscess
plague of far righteousness
all fates hang in the balance
mocking crucified dolls
an inquisition outs
when the sun goes out our powers
will extend throughout heaven like asphodel
as they have for countless lustrum
in dark midian accustoned
to burning effigies of our enemies well
so begins the sibilant world death knell
when a corpse wind howls
and awakes from drowse
the scheming dead freed
of gossamer shrouds
we gorgonise eyes
of the storm aroused
red
blinding time
all lines dine on this instance
a melting spool of beggar, negative frames
the skies teem alive, to watch die
mankind hauled to fable in vast tenement graves
cthulhu dawn
lurking in the shade
of dark and fragrant trees
shirking from the rage
that tore the heavens free
a vagrant angel
his with span to see
the garden swell with terrors
to banish man and eve
another fall from grace
whiplashed from the gates
half naked and insane
full blooded, breasted
nerve ends tested
to behests of pain
a sombre lot to gain
as the storm slid in
borne by carnal winds
the upper ether thinned
and therein sat abominations
satan seated there
to savoring the reek of desolation
but their dank despair
moved his speech to leech the air
"behold the golden door
paradise is lost
so praise me as you raised your lord
and i shall thaw this gnawing frost"
another fall from grace
whiplashed from the gates
half naked and insane
and destined for a spiteful fate
wherein evil sought the shamed
as pawns in greater stakes
across this cosmic game
to win the hand of darkness and
set her in her rightful place
cursed is the ground for thy sake
in sorrow thou shalt eat of it all the days of thy life
thorns also and thistles shall bring it forth to thee
and thou shalt eat the herb of the field
in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread
till thou return unto the ground
for out of it was thou taken
for dust thou art and unto dust shalt thou now return
with that the pact was sealed
and as creation reeled
bewitched oration filled
the hearts of all
who came to crawl
upon these earthen fields
a sombre lot to till
a wracked black acid song
spat from the massive throng
of seraph knelt along
the deep red welt to domination
the deep red welt to domination
domination, domination, domination
the deep red welt to domination
domination
the deep red welt to domination
better to reign in hell
heart in hand passed to the clasp of pain
in a dark lowland that set bad blood in veins
burning, like penal fires roused to strain
the jaggedtoothed skyline braced with crosses
the golden dawn
lay lost to mist where
emboldened thorns
made their bed with toppled stones
he closed his eyes
sunken to dream there of crowblack skies
and a great white empty throne
horror stalked the bilious fogs that balked his visions
he licked the spittle from the cheeks of the wry
and drifted back to when his stung its target
the sneer of michael on a glorious high
of angel dust and virtue by his side
better to reign in hell
drowning in the past
that downfall seemed like yesterday
though blurred moons passed
as enemies in high places laughed
moved to mirrors cracked with heavy lines
he rose snow blind, through shifting sands of time
erased the trace and taste of bitter wines
the grapes of wrath grew fat on the vine
she came to him
a little whip of tantrums
thrashed on velvet skins
that lines her wishbone henge
her name was sin, a warming spurt of mantras
splashed on occult tongues that whispered sweet revenge
for the shame of their crawl from grace
cold and hollow as the grave
and for a rape and ruinous scourge
spared for souls that shared god's worship
for now their throats coated notes with dirge
that poured from parapets to the pits below
better to reign in hell
drowning in the past
a wretched scream like yesterday
died at last with the rising of the revenant dark
all sharpened claws and blunt discharge
i shall bow no more to the dogs of the lord
tearing at my carcass heart
i shall fall to my knees only at the keyholes
of virtue slipping into bondage masks
freewill made me better to reign in hell
and with new wings unfurled and spoken
he took to things that would desecrate the world
the seduction of both woman and man
for a bastard master plan
better to reign in hell
drowning out the past
fool fates unwound cruel yesterdays
beneath the stars
that staggered from the blast
and i often sigh
i often wonder why
i'm still here and i still cry
and i often cry
i often spill a tear
over those not here
but still they are so near
please ease my burden
and i still remember
a memory and i weep
in my broken sleep
the scars they cut so deep
please ease my burden
please ease my pain
surely without war there would be no loss
hence no mourning, no grief, no pain, no misery
no sleepless nights missing the dead ... oh, no more
no more war
i. benighted like usher
snuffed tapers sighed
as death left impressing
his crest of cold tears on the countess
benighted like illfated usher
the house of bathory shrouded
'neath grief's dark facade
if only i could have wept
in mourning by her side
i would have clasped her so tight
like stormbeached aphrodite
drowned on kytherean tides
and kissed her
for from her alone
my lips would have known
enigmas of shadowy vistas
where pleasures took flesh
and pain, remorseless
came freezing the breath
of raucous life hushed unto whispers
benighted.
inhaling the pale waning moonlight that crept
through the crypt of her lord who so lucidly slept
benighted.
exhaling the wail of black widowhood's toll
waxing eternal night entered her soul
ii. a murder of ravens in fugue
now haranguing grey skies
with revenge upon life
gnathic and sapphic
needs begged gendercide
delusions of grandier denounced the revolt
of descrying cursed glass, disenchanted in vaults
encircled by glyphs midst her sinsistered cult
with hangman's abandon she plied spiritworlds
to archangels in bondage
from light to night hurled
cast down to the earth where torment would unfurl.......
but soon,
her tarot proved
hybrid rumours spread like tumours
would accrue
and blight her stars
however scarred
to better bitter truths
of cold bloodbaths
as bodies rose
in rigid droves
to haunt her from their
shallow burials imposed
when wolves exhumed
their carthen wombs
where heavy frosts had laboured long
to bare their wounds
to the depths of her soul they pursued
wielding their poison they flew
like a murder of ravens in fugue
and knowing their raptures
would shatter her dreams
she clawed blackened books for damnation's reprieve
baneful cawed canons on amassed enemies
so hallow's eve
as she received
like bellona to the ball
those enemies
fellsisters heaved
her torturies
cross stained flagstones
to her carriage reined to flee
but she knew she must brave the night through
though fear crept a deathshead o'er the moon
like a murder of ravens in fugue
for each masked, jewelled gaze held dread purpose
horror froze painted eyes to cold stares
and even her dance
in the vast mirrors cast
looked the ill of her future
if fate feasted there....
iii. eyes that witnessed madness
in an age crucified by the nails of faith
when rank scarecrows of christ blighted lands
an aloof countess born an obsidian wraith
dared the abyss knowing well she was damned
her life whispered grief like a funeral march
twisted and yearning, obsessed an entranced
with those succumbing to cruelty
crushed 'neath the gait of her dance
a whirlwind of fire that swept through the briers
of sweet rose her thickets of black thorn had grasped...
she demanded the heavens and forever to glean
the elixir of youth from the pure
whilst her lesbian fantasies
reamed to extremes
o'er decades unleashed
came for blood's silken cure
but her reign ended swiftly
for dark gods dreamt too deep
to heed her pleas
when her gaolers were assailed
with condemnations from a priest
who'd stammered rites
in the dead of night
for maidens staining winding sheets
and she postured proud
when her crimes were trowelled
and jezebelled to peasant lips
though she smelt the fires
that licked limbs higher
to the tortured cunts of accomplices
so ends this twisted fable's worth
and though spared the pyre's bite
by dint of nobled bloodlined birth
her sins crimes garnered her no respite
forever severed from the thrill of coming night
where slow death alone could grant her flight
"the spirits have all but fled judgement
i rot, alone, insane,
where the forest whispers puce laments for me
from amidst the pine and wreathed wolfsbane
beyond these walls, wherein condemned
to the gloom of an austere tomb
i pace with feral madness sent
through the pale beams of a guiltless moon
who, bereft of necrologies, thus
commands creation over the earth
whilst i resign my lips to death
a slow cold kiss that chides rebirth
though one last wish is bequathed by fate
my beauty shalt wilt, unseen
save for twin black eyes that shalt come to take
my soul to peace or hell for company"
to peace or hell for company
my soul to hell for company
evening minuetto in a castle by the sea
a jewel more radiant than the moon
lowered her mask to me
the sublimest creature the gods, full of fire
would marvel at making their queen
infusing the air with her fragrant desire
and my heart reeled with grave poetry
from grace i fell in love with her
scent and feline lure
and jade woodland eyes that ushered in the impurest
"erotic, laden fantasies amid this warm autumn night
she lulled me away from the rich masquerade
and together we clung in the bloodletting moonlight"
pearled luna, what spell didst thou cast on me?
her icy kiss fervoured my neck
like whispering waves 'pon acheron's beach
in a whirl of sweet voices and statues
that phantomed the dying trees
this debauched seductress in black, took me
in a pale azured dawn like ligeia reborn
i tore free of my sleep  sepulchre
on the sea misted lawn where stone figures, forlorn
lamented the spectre of her
bewildered and weak, yet with passion replete
i hungered for past overtures
the curse of unrest and her ardent caress
came much more than my soul could endure
i, at once endeavoured to see her again
stirring from midnight's inertia
knowing not even her name
on a thin precipice over carnal abyss
i danced like a blind acolyte
drunk on red wine, her dead lips on mine
suffused with the perfume of night
for hours i scoured the surrounding grounds
in vain that we might meet
when storm clouds broke, ashened, fatigued
i sought refuge in a cemeterty
sleep, usher dreams
taint to nightmares from a sunless nether
mistress of the dark
i now know what thou art
screams haunt my sleep
dragged from nightmares thou hast wed together
lamia and lemures
spawned thee leche
to snare my flesh
portrait of the dead countess
deep stained pain that i had dreamt
flaunted demise, life's punishment
leaving little strength to seal this wretched tomb
but poised nectar within my stirs
up feverous desire and morbid purpose to search
through cobwebbed drapery to where she swoons
goddess of the graveyard, of the tempest and moon
in flawless fatal beauty her very visage compels
glimpses of a heaven where ghost companies fell
to mourning the loss of god in blackest velvet
enrobed in their downfall like a swift silhouette
"fleeting, enshadowed
thou art privy to my sin
secrets dead, wouldst thou inflict
the cruel daylights upon my skin?
dost thou not want to worship me
with crimson sacrifice
so my cunt may twitch against thy kiss
and weep with newfound life?"
red roses for the devil's whore
dark angels taste my tears
and whisper haunting requiems
softly to mine ear
needfires have lured abominations here
nocturnal pulse
my veins spill forth their waters
rent by lips i cherish most
awash on her perfidious shores
where drowning umbra o'er the stars
ebon's graves where lovers whore
like seraphim and nahemah
"nahemah"
pluck out mine eyes, hasten, attest
blind reason against thee, enchantress
for i must know, art thou not death?
my heart echoes bloodless and incensed
doth temptation prowl night in vulvic revelry
did not the queen of heaven come as devil to me?
on that fatal hallow's eve when we fled company
as the music swept around us in the crisp, fated leaves
under horned diana where her bloodline was sewn
in a graveyard of angels rent in cool marbled stone
i am grieving the loss of life in sombre velvet
enrobed in death's shadow like a swifter
silhouette
and the earth was without form and void
and darkness was upon the face of the deep
"mirror, mirror on the wall
shouldst not grave pleasures be my all?
for if i shall see thy will be done
grant me the witchcraft of thy tongue"
three moondials froze in the shadow of six
as another soul passed to the grasping styx
clutching their trinket crucifix
bats blew from caves in a dissonant surge
omens of corruption from within the church
a fetid, dank oasis still clung to fool rebirth
alone as a stone cold altar
the castle and its keep
like faerytale dominion rose
a widow to the snow peaks
wherein reclined the countess
limbs purring from the kill
bathed in virgin white and like the night
alive and young and unfulfilled
was it the cry of a wolf
that broke the silver thread of enchanted thoughts?
of her life as a mere reflection
as the moon's in narrow windows caught
that opened like dark eyelids on
the sigh of the woods that the wind fell upon
like a siren weaving song
from the lilt of choirs choking
where the vengeful dead
belong...
to the sorceress and her charnel arts
she swept from ebon towers at the hour of mars
'neath a starinwoven sky latticed by scars
to unbind knotted reins that kept in canter, despair
shod on melancholy, fleet to sanctuary there,
in netherglades tethered where onyx idols stared
was it the kiss of the mist
that peopled the air with the prowess of absinthe?
lost souls begging resurrection
from gods upon their forest plinths
whose epitaphs read of reascending to win
remission from despair through a holocaust of sin
in a tongue hilted in invective rectums
over signs and seals the sorceress prayed
to death, to rend the slender veil
that ancient ones might rise again
as shadows swelled
the countess fell
to masturbating with her dagger
as the witch gabbled spells
cumming heavy roses all the way to hell
as sudden thunder's grue harangue
announced two pincered worlds
exuding bane, something came
with the stench of necrophiled graves
to these clandestines
who shrank from glimpsing horror
that the growls of mating houls inclined...
resplendent
in pendants
natal trophies torn from bellies of desanctified nuns
a demons, bewinged, bedight
in scum, prowled their circle seeking entry to run
an arctic tongue upon her vulva
where rubies smeared to alabaster thighs
glittered like a contract in the purse of a whore
receiving sole communion from the body of christ
"if blood is what thou carves, foul fiend
i will yield this witch to thee
if thou wouldst draw a veil for me
o'er lengthening scars of age and grief"
as the demon slavered foetid vows
and bore his prey away
in talons itching to perpetrate
the nausea of eternal rape
the sorceress screaming in his grasp
spat a final curse to stain
the countess with the promise
that her lord at war would be cruelly slain
and she would rot.
alone
insane.
on the twisted nails of faith.
led to the river
midsummer i wave
a 'v' of black swans
on with hope to the grave
and through red september
when skies firepaved
i begged you appear
like a thorn for the holy ones
cold was my soul
untold was the pain
i faced, when you left me
a rose in the rain
so i swore to the razor
that never, enchained
would your dark nails of faith
be pushed through my veins again
bared on your tomb
i am a prayer for your loneliness
and would you ever soon
come above unto me?
for once upon a time
from the binds of your loneliness
i could always find
the right slot for your sacred key
six feet deep is the incision
in my heart that barless prison
discolors all with tunnel vision
sunsetter, nymphetamine
sick and weak from my condition
this lust, this vampiric addiction
to her alone in full submission
none better, nymphetamine
nymphetamine, nymphetamine
nymphetamine girl
nymphetamine, nymphetamine
my nymphetamine girl
wracked with your charm, i'm circled like prey
back in the forest where whispers persuade
more sugar trails, more white lady laid
than pillars of salt
fall to my arms
hold their mesmeric sway
and dance out to the moon
as we did in those golden days
christening stars
i remember the way
we were needle and spoon
mislaid in the burning hay
bared on your tomb
i am a prayer for your loneliness
and would you ever soon
come above unto me?
for once upon a time
from the bind of your holiness
i could always find
the right slot for your sacred key
six feet deep is the incision
in my heart that barless prison
discolors all with tunnel vision
sunsetter, nymphetamine
sick and weak from my condition
this lust, this vampiric addiction
to her alone in full submission
none better, nymphetamine
sunsetter, nymphetamine
none better, nymphetamine
nymphetamine, nymphetamine
nymphetamine girl
nymphetamine, nymphetamine
my nymphetamine girl
when the sun has wept upon the waveless lake
and the mists steal in with ease
covened wolves are their eerie dissonant napes
in adoration of the moon and thee
"they call as i to thee"
and i will come, as if in dream
my languid, dark and lustrous malaresian queen
of vengeful, ancient breed
gilded with the pelts of many enemies
erishkigal, ravenhaired
thy seduction haunts the castle in erotic despair
i can taste thy scent by candlelight
legs of porcelain traced and laced to their lair
appease the beast on spattered sheets
dyed unearthly red as sobriety weeps
nocternity
she shall come for me
a black velvet painting sprung to elegant life
like a poignant madonna perverted to night
and i have ridden from the westerning light
to expend my lust
tear away the funereal dress
know that i will escape from my death
surrendered to the splendour of her sharpened caress
lo! the pale moonlight
weaves a poetic spell of vital death and decline
of mist and moth and the hunger inside
kisses took to fever and the fever, demise
"through twilight, darkness and moonrise
my scarlet tears will run
as stolen blood and whispered love
of fantasies undone"
countess swathed in ebony
and snowwhite balletic grace
rougefilmed lips procure the wish
for lust and her disgrace
dusk and her embrace
we shall flirt through the shadows
like a dream of werewolves in the snow
under deadly nightshade
still warmed with the kill's afterglow
beneath the stars thy flesh bedevils me
beneath the stars taste the death in me
bequeath to me thy fiery kiss
to sever thin mortality
elizabeth
my heart is thine
thy fragrant words warm within like wine
"let me come to thee
with eyes like asphodel
moonglancing, loose desires free
to writhe under my spell"
ereshkigal, ravenhaired
thy seduction haunts the castle in erotic despair
i know thy scent by candlelight
immortal flesh i yearn to share
appease the beast on spattered sheets
dyed malefic red as sobriety weeps
nocternity
she shall come for me
unfurl thy limbs breathless succubus
how the full embosomed fog
imparts the night to us
distant vistas, swathed in the haze
of the reddening sunset
fell to whispers 'neath stars
that marred descending skies
from the cusp of midnight mountains
wending as a mist
rebels truced with feriluce
in truth, few could resist
came praising his hell raising through
the sparse and marble clime
where virtue bathed, their ravings made
her fountains flood with wine
lifted with the gift
of their dark seductive songs
she drifted from the path
she was surely set upon
courting chaos, prized in sight
of the covering angel, taught in ways of
smothering another lover
other than god
worshiped in each other's arms
like spider eidolons
the moon conducted like a charm
those strange attachments on
and this is how they came to be
dragged before the throne
through tongues that hung whilst theirs were run
on soft white throats and punctured moans
though fated now than later
by his tutor that had been
he baited the creator
with the future he had seen
of michael, psyched with jealousies
a reich right by his side
and worming man about to be
the apple of his eye
his children lost to free will
and the cost of beaten hearts
like the night 'twixt vice and virtue
when her kiss became a scar
seraph enemies
why has my lord forsaken my judgment
am i not free as he
to indulge my darkest fantasies?
from embittered lips
these words were slaved
split with the whips
of their witch hunt gathered
he sought her grave
midst drowning crowds that howled in rage
blasphemer, blasphemer though she was gone
not lyriced to the song of their spirited throng
but ghosted back where she belong
a grace embracing michael
in a lace of tears that bleared his pride
he swallowed, blood followed
though with spit for all things divine
though with spit for all things so fucking blind
his seal he tore and to the floor
he threw this tie to heaven
signifying holy war
and watchful of this sign
a thousand flames, unauthorized
left celestial posts
to coalesce and, unified
return their fallen leader
as he turned one final time
and threw a glance
like a downward lance
that stung like guilt in every mind
from the primeval mass
let precious chaos vent
sacred flesh drenched in fornication
beloved by set
may the winds gather her together
from the secrets of men
after thousands of years of terrifying silence
she comes again
all destroyer
the abolition of the yeshua begins
shattered are the icons of the worthless
the goddess scorned is a valkyrie born
scattered are the wings of the virulent holy
leave their husks to be the prey of vultures and dogs
world without end
cherish the lissome wants of pernicious evil
dusk in her eyes
torn bloody weeping skies
darkness will hasten to devour
and the weak will flee or die
sie sind es die sich
anderlieb festhalten
fuer immer betend auf knien
vor der finisteren goetten
i slay the lamb in the fervour of thine
abandonment unto our lady
with a quenchless thirst for the infinite
for her that exists beyond all knowledge
storming from tired centuries
under the glare of a waxing deathmoon
terrible beauty of love severed
rip the baby from the virginal womb
the blood of jesus
is the wine of the dead
and the drunken angels
bleed with incest
the liliot suckle on her fruitful breasts
and yield the swords that sever and stain
there will be no act or passion wrought
that shall not be attributed to her names
to the name of baphomet
artemis, bastet, astarte
i yearn to thee who art darkness in thy rising
"weltmacht oder niedergang"
instrumental
two thousand fattened years like maniacs
have despoiled our common grave
now what necrophagous second coming backs
from the cradle to enslave?
sickle constellations
stud the velts that welt the sku
whilst the bitter winter moon
prowls the clouds, dead,eyed
like shifting parent flesh
under silk matricide...
watchful as she was upon eden
where every rose arbour and orchard she swept
hid the hissing of a serpent libido
in an ancient tryst with catastrophe
soon to be kept
hear that hissing now on the breeze
as through the plundered groves of the carnal garden
a fres horror blows
but ten billion souls
are blind to see the rotting wood for the trees
this is the theme to a better armageddon
nightchords rake the heavens
pandaemonaeon
and what use are prayers to that 'god '?
as devils bay concenus for the space to piss
on your smouldering faith
and the the mouldering face
of this world long a paradise lost
this is the end of everything
hear the growing chora that a new dawn shall bring
dance macabre 'neath the tilt of the zodiac
now brighter stars shall reflect on our fate
what sick activities will be freed when those lights burn black?
the darkside of the mirror always threw our malice back...
i see the serpentine in your eyes
the nature of the beast as revelations arrive
our screams shall trail to angels
for those damned in flames repay
all sinners lose their lot on judgement day
we should have cut our losses as at calvary
but our hearts like heavy crosses held the vain belief
salvation, like a promised nation
gleamed a claim away...
this is the end of everything you have ever known
buried like vanquished reason
death in season
driven like the drifting snow
peace, a fragile lover, left us fantasising war
on our knees or another fucker 's shore
heiling new flesh
read, then roared
to a crooked cross and a holy cause
what else be whipped to frenzy for?
this is the end of everything
rear the tragedies
that the seraphim shall sing
old adversaries
next of eve
now they 're clawing back
i smell their cumming
as through webbed panes of meat
led by hoary death
they never left
dreaming sodomies
to impress on human failure
when we 've bled upon our knees
tablatures of gravel law
shall see gehennag paved
when empires fall
and nightmares crawl
from the cradle to enslave...
this is the end of everything
i'm chaos international
the writing on the wall
a lazarus in parable
a dark and sullen lullaby
whispered softly as you die
promising torments are nigh
danger warning levels hissed out loud
i saw the silver lining hidden in a mushroom cloud
now i'm reeling from the shock at ground zero
if yesterday you would have stood up proud
then why tonight have you thrown in with the stoning crowd?
i'll breathe through the foetus of a new day kicking...
the foetus of a new day kicking
it's true that jesus cannot save
i'm rising from the grave
to put my double cross to shame
a poison rush, a heart attack
a white assassin painted black
you'll fear this reaper coming back
danger warning levels hissed out loud
i saw the silver lining hidden in a mushroom cloud
now i'm reeling from the shock at ground zero
if yesterday you would have stood up proud
then why tonight have you thrown in with the stoning crowd?
i'll breathe through the foetus of a new day kicking...
on a night like this
you laid the serpent's kiss
in this garden of gethsemane
you played the traitor well...
in a dawn to come
i will blind the sun
to grant you pardon as my enemy
before damning you to hell...
in an age crucified by the nails of faith
when rank scarecrows of christ blighted lands
an aloof countess born an obsidian wraith
dared the abyss knowing well she was damned
her life whispered grief like a funeral march
twisted and yearning, obsessed an entranced
with those succumbing to cruelty
crushed 'neath the gait of her dance
a whirlwind of fire that swept through the briers
of sweet rose her thickets of black thorn had grasped...
she demanded the heavens and forever to glean
the elixir of youth from the pure
whilst her lesbian fantasies
reamed to extremes
o'er decades unleashed
came for blood's silken cure
but her reign ended swiftly
for dark gods dreamt too deep
to heed her pleas
when her gaolers were assailed
with condemnations from a priest
who'd stammered rites
in the dead of night
for maidens staining winding sheets
and she postured proud
when her crimes were trowelled
and jezebelled to peasant lips
though she smelt the fires
that licked limbs higher
to the tortured cunts of accomplices
so ends this twisted fable's worth
and though spared the pyre's bite
by dint of nobled bloodlined birth
her sins crimes garnered her no respite
forever severed from the thrill of coming night
where slow death alone could grant her flight
"the spirits have all but fled judgement
i rot, alone, insane,
where the forest whispers puce laments for me
from amidst the pine and wreathed wolfsbane
beyond these walls, wherein condemned
to the gloom of an austere tomb
i pace with feral madness sent
through the pale beams of a guiltless moon
who, bereft of necrologies, thus
commands creation over the earth
whilst i resign my lips to death
a slow cold kiss that chides rebirth
though one last wish is bequathed by fate
my beauty shalt wilt, unseen
save for twin black eyes that shalt come to take
my soul to peace or hell for company"
my soul to hell for company
i'm waiting in my cold cell
when the bell begins to chime
reflecting on my past life and it doesn't have much time
'cause at five o'clock they take me to the gallows pole
the sands of time for me are running low
motherfuckers!
running low
when the priest come's to read me the last rites
i take look through the bars at the last sights
of a world that has gone very wrong for me
can it be that there's some sort of error
hard to stop the surmounting terror
is it really the end not some crazy dream
somebody please tell me that i'm dreaming it's not easy to stop from screaming
but words escape me when i try to speak
tears they flow but why am i crying after all i'm not afraid of dying
don't believe that there never is an end
as the guards march me out of the courtyard
someone calls from a cell:"god be with you"
if there's an god why has he let me die!
as i walk through the drifts before me
and though the end is near i''m not sorry
catch my soul 'cause it's willing fly away
mark my words believe my soul lives on
please don't worry now that i have gone
i've gone beyond to seek the truth
when you know that your time is at close hand
maybe then you begin to understand why
we, the nocturnal few
bound by other laws
to the service of the enemies of god
are silent and hidden
yet our exquisite fire burns on
poised to engulf
tie a man to his god
he may not walk for fear
of falling foul to temptation
where once faith stood her ground
renounce the guilt, ignite the flame
cast the fetid virgin back from where she came
drink deep of the promise in my eyes
of mist and midnight skies
i drown in fathomless dreams
and in the reeking mire of virtue scream
i yearn to sell my very soul
and you shall for none so dark and sinister
will arise to embrace the arts
do what thou wilt
until the stones in my heart stand still
regardless of the cost to your repugnant god
the last may frost may blight the crops
and will never be ascribed to be heavenly dog
or nature, but infernal tasks
"by your cursings and imprecations
you wrong both man and beast
by whatever whim you serve
of the devil your leige"
tie belief to the trinity, and seven ways
will be wrought to condemn thee
conspiring to cull the pagan ways
twist back their lies, personify their needs
the war begins by satanic decree
if evil we be, we will our lives
to mist and midnight skies
i will avenge the deaths of a thousand burning children
be bound to a covenant with us in our hellish league
and bring the host of the nazarene to their knees
breath the life of an entity neverborn
darkness now descend in raven form
the words, the burning rasp, vibrate the cosmic thread
arcturus is risen queen, hold forth the severed head to me
i pour my lovelorn kisses at your feet
raper of all my worldly enemies
lycanthropy, please poison me
send acausal instincts crawling my brain
take me, mistress, until perversion is fed
dark magick pleasures weaved under the jeweled moonhead
the crossstick will fade when the usurper hangs
for now we congregate where once my angel sang
that night they came and took her away from me
i lost the woman i loved and i learned how to curse
and to spit in the face of their, "god"
we will ride again
in the midnight skies
weak midnight promised of love
were wept upon her grave
and shunned by stars above
in mortal life lurks my dismay
an angel stole my heart
and death took her away
she sleeps beyond the grace of god
a dreamingly beauty
if wishes could only fray that bond
twelfth moon arose with ghostly voice
a poet's serenade
her name a whisper pon my lips
and lo, rorasa came
"fear me not my grieving king
funeral in breath
the secrets of the dark i know
and thus, we shall cheat death"
my promises wrought through despondence that night
have delievered me gifts from the grave
rorasa enshadowed me gifts from the grave
never a devil so vain
the angel is fallen, for i thought her lost
and no heaven would silence the pain
teach me these secrets, the sensual frost
desire for warm blood again
princess lay down they florid cheek
in drunken splendour
tonight rare regal fate has cast
the wolves among the sheep
dark nature clasp my soul
around her throat mine arms enfold
to sleep, perchance to dream
and then...
to dusk and flesh ascend
the sun descends magenta spirits fill the skies
and wreak erotic maladies where sex and death abide
from writhing tides where gothick siren weave their song to shore
through the ashes of the battlefields where ravens and angels war
we rule like the red and risen moon upon the sea
the stars of judgement silent, for we share joyous
eternity
damnation
salvation
stigmata plague
the wine of bacchus flows
listen to the thunder rage
deceivers dragged before their cross
i am he that vanquished death
and bore the sting of loss
what vulgar christ will uprise my grasp
his temple, ruined, burns
and sweet rorasa laughs
i am enamoured and impradised
to catch the fires dancing profanely in her eyes
"i will crush them all
if this holds thy delight"
rather dead forever than to lose her
nymphlascvious aphrodite
through acrid clouds of summer flies
the garden swells with a thousand more wise
forever flung to celestial dreams
clawing at the grave of the dead nazarene
i watch the storm approaching
the darkness calls my name
the trees are growing restless
they feel the season change
their fruit has putrefied
forbidden once and bound to die
the thread of life lies severed
on the brink of paradise
grinning winds of hate unfurled
dash towers tall that grip the sun
talons stretch her veil
reclamation, our time has come
autumn spreads its golden wings
and lays the path for those unseen
a tangled web of evil spun at last
winter spawn from barren thighs
to readdress, to slay the blind
and throw the reins untethered to the skies
they pray to the full moon rising
diana moving with such infinite grace
wrapped alone in a blanket of nightfall
how many secrets can they read by your face?
will they know of majesty
of beauty held in dreamdead sleep
and scarlet seas that bleed the frozen shores?
will their "god" of bridled love
assuage our rule from planes above
or shrink in fear from chaos roused for war?
war!
wrest askew the nails
that have held you, lurking deep
september prayers are waning
burn the shrines of fettered sheep
spearhead the insurrection
of a world that seeks no end
"we are what we are, what we shall be, again..."
appear draped in terror
to the comfort of your kin
stain the milky sunset red
and let the other in...
summer's dying...
nights came tralling ghost concertos
heartstrings a score of skeletal reaper bows
playing torture chamber music allegretto
conducting over throes trashed to crescendo
skinless the dark shall scream
hoarse her symphonies
deathmashed as the moon
that had lifted her dreams
and frowned on the winding steps down
to where the vulgar strayed,
taunting sick her tender prey
she glided in her bridal gown
how sleep the pure
desire in violent overture
an emanation of phantom madness
the countess beheld in shroud
by girls bereft of future vows
soon to wed in white the frosted ground
burning like a brand on the countenance of god
a yearning took her hand to his seraphim, bound
deep red hissed the cat whips
on the whim of illwill
whilst she entranced, nonchalant, abliss
flayed further songs of overkill
how weep the pure
desire in violent overture
in a crescentwhime cellar of crushed roses
pooled blood and broken dolls
a torchlit shadow theatre souled
with the echoed cries of lives she stole
killing time
she struck the hours dead
in her control
thus menopaused
her clock of hacked out cunts
began to toll
"thirteen chimes of ancient strain
i conjure forth with dirge
that fills the void with timbred pain
to fulfil my sexual urge"
frights came wailing from the darkside
haunting lipless mouths a fugue of arcane diatribes
velvet, their voices coffined her in slumber
bespattered and appeased
as pregnant skies outside bore thunder
how sleep the pure
desire in violent overture
as when high winds
attune whipped trees
her savage nature pitched
would once again conduct the pleas
of those she loved to agonies
as if it were
the first time every night
that she carved her seal
in the flesh of life.
snuffed tapers sighed
as death left impressing
his crest of cold tears on the countess
benighted like illfated usher
the house of bathory shrouded
'neath griefs dark facade
if only i could have wept
in mourning by her side
i would have clasped her so tight
like stormbeached aphrodite
drowned on kytherean tides
and kissed her
for from her alone
my lips would have known
enigmas of shadowy vistas
where pleasures took flesh
and pain, remorseless
came freezing the breath
of raucous life hushed unto whispers
benighted.
inhaling the pale waning moonlight that crept
through the crypt of her lord who so lucidly slept
benighted.
exhaling the wail of black widowhood's toll
waxing eternal night entered her soul
led to the river
midsummer i wave
a 'v' of black swans
on with hope to the grave
and through red september
when skies firepaved
i begged you appear
like a incomprehensible ones
cold was my soul
untold was the pain
i faced, when you left me
a rose in the rain
so i swore to the razor
that never, enchained
would your dark nails of faith
be pushed through my veins again
bared on your tomb
i am a prayer for your loneliness
and would you ever soon
come above unto me?
for once upon a time
from the binds of your loneliness
i could always find
the right slot for your sacred key
six feet deep is the incision
in my heart that barless prison
discolors all with tunnel vision
sunsetter, nymphetamine
sick and weak from my condition
this lust, this vampiric addiction
to her alone in full submission
none better, nymphetamine
nymphetamine, nymphetamine
nymphetamine girl
nymphetamine, nymphetamine
my nymphetamine girl
wracked with your charm, i'm circled like prey
back in the forest where whispers persuade
more sugar trails, more white lady laid
than pillars of salt
fall to my arms
hold their mesmeric sway
and dance out to the moon
as we did in those golden days
christening stars
i remember the way
we were needle and spoon
mislaid in the burning hay
bared on your tomb
i am a prayer for your loneliness
and would you ever soon
come above unto me?
for once upon a time
from the bind of your holiness
i could always find
the right slot for your sacred key
six feet deep is the incision
in my heart that barless prison
discolors all with tunnel vision
sunsetter, nymphetamine
sick and weak from my condition
this lust, this vampiric addiction
to her alone in full submission
none better, nymphetamine
sunsetter, nymphetamine
none better, nymphetamine
nymphetamine, nymphetamine
nymphetamine girl
nymphetamine, nymphetamine
my nymphetamine girl
come distortured artists
bitter things seek meaning
even if they're madness to behold
once forbears to horizons
where the dead stayed dreaming
now nightmares waken souls
that fear the living's toll
gova, bosch and brueghel
three times moonwise stain thy graves
for words alone are at loss to trace
the face of today's inhuman wraith
one half adrift in the vast abyss
of despair and misery
the other a mask of rich red lips
whetted by the fevers of belief and greed
all damned in this inferno
where even virgil averts his eyes
from the black mass mutual gang rape
of caesing hands an forced divides
trespass these seven gates
to a world bloodlet to shades
where seraphim bleat
of their cold and coming master's race
in the seweres of babylon
stillborn to a trough anon
chimiracles will hatch like plots
to dredge faeces to pearl their cross
enter penteholocaust
five aeons past, yet still man grasps
at final straws to save his cast
his lord is a leper we shall not want
he betrayed us with white lies
his acrid pall as of the tomb
reminds us how we rot inside
gutted like fool's paradise
glutted on cruel appetites
holding court to chaos
folding to far graver arms
a downfall fatal to all resounds
as orgies peak in self centred psalms
and nature screams her sufferings
under bowed and cankered wings
a bleak scorched earth necrotica burning
like the robes we've torn from her
she begs us lay her pain to rest
lest we are left with nothingness
save for her stripped and ravished flesh
and if her fate is not portent of apocalypse
then the comets that graxe nightskies
will surely cleanse of wrongs and reichs
when you and i and all else dies
it's rotting down
this carcass maggotropolis
interdependent as worms to the grave
allah's true name is naught
chist cannot save
locked in a waltz of evermore frantic steps
spells of regret
death magick for adepts
be prepared to fulfill prophecies
the glorious fall of a sin dynasty
gutted like fool's paradise
glutted on cruel appeitites
we've woven hearts a thorn arbour
left tear streaked reason upon the shore
and bereft of compass, star or more
set out for this world's end
few at the prow, most slave below
painting coal a perfect gold
but for all it's worth, the engines slow
dead in the brine again
come cabin fever, sodomy on the bounty
prey to phallus seas
that hiss and foam to douse disease
a storm roars on the way
blacker than the ace of rapes
dealt out by death in darkwood glades
our ship of fools, all boards handmade
sinks, dashed by seismic waves
i was born with a birthmark of cinders
debris cast from the stars and mother
a ring of bright slaughter, i spat in the waters
of life that ran slick from the stab wounds in her
dub me lord abortion, the living dead
the bone saw on the backseat
on this bitter night of giving head
a sharp rear entry, an exit in red
lump in the throat, on my come choke
the killing joke worn thin with breath
i grew up on the sluts bastard father beat blue
keepsake cunts cut full out easing puberty through
aah!
nostalgia grows
now times nine or ten
within this vice den called a soul
dying resurrection
i dig deep to come again
the spasm of orgasm on a roll
i live the slow serrated rape
the bucks fizz of amyl nitrate
victims force fed their own face
tear stains upon the drape
i should compare them
to a warm summer's day
but to the letter, it is better
to lichen their names to a grave
counting my years on an abacus strung
with labial rings and heartstrings undone
dub me lord abortion, the living dead
the bone saw on the backseat
on this bitter night of giving head
a sharp rear entry, an exit in red
lump in the throat, on my come choke
the killing joke worn thin with breath
horrorscopes my diorama
a twelve part so far psychodrama
another chained i mean to harm her
inside as well as out
a perverts gasp inside the mask
i'm hard, blow my house of cards
all turn up death, her bleeding starts
in brute vermilion parts
now i slither through the hairline cracks
in sanity, best watch your back
possessed with levering hell's gates wide
liberating knives to cut humanity slack
my ambition is to slay anon
a sinner in the hands of a dirty god
who lets me pray, a gilles de rais
of light where faith leads truth astray
i slit guts guts and free the moistest faces
corrupt the corpse and seize the choicest pieces
her alabaster limbs that dim the lit carnal grin
vaginal skin to later taste and masturbate within
"my heart was a wardrum beat
by jugular cults in eerie jungle vaults
when number thirteen fell in my lap
lips and skin like sin, a venus mantrap
my appetite whetted, storm crows wheeled
at the blurred edges or reason 'til i was fulfilled
whors d'oeuvres eaten, i tucked her into
a grave coffin fit for the queen of spades
she went out like the light in my mind
her face an avalanche of pearl, of ruby wine
much was a flux, but the mouth once good for fucks
came from retirement to prove she had not lost her touch
i kissed her viciously, maliciously, religiously
but when has one been able to best separate the three?
i know i'm sick as dahmer did, but this is what i do
aah, aah, ahh, i'll let you sleep when i am through"
the suspect shadow sher they least
expect my burning grasp to reach
the stranglehold, the opened arms
seeking sweet meat with no holes barred
rainbows that my razors wrung
midst her screams and seams undone
sung at the top of punctured lungs
i bite my spiteful tongue
lest curses spat from primal lairs
freeze romance where angels, bare
are lost to love, blood loss, despair
i weep, they merely stare
and stare, and stare, and stare, and stare.
we rise with the sun in the underworld
we suffer from a graveless name
we prise wide lids
and wounds with lips curled
over teeth that have tasted shame
cemetery and sundown
against the flora of nightfall
we gather like the fauna of war
to curse aurora so spiteful
with her stake in the coming of dawn
to conjure forth the past
those heady night of pain resplendent
in the service of the goddess of death
when her sheets ran royalty red
moons lengthen our crypt kept silhouettes
shadows dance, eyes flicker in descent
unveil the greed, our needs are bitter, spent
on upturned mouths and haunts of wickedness
we walk this eden, a secret
faces hidden under leonine pride
in dusk's embrace
we find it hard to keep it
when blood and lust and waking worlds collide
too long have we skulked like drifters
in the cities of the neon sun
vagabond dogs and graveyard shifters
mona lisas where the paint has run
i miss our glorious past
our nightly flights on fear dependent
like phantoms in the caves for miss christine
when the song bird broke her neck
wolves howl their foghound serenades
churches arch their backs with balustrades
praise be to the shedding of masquerades
when we hunt these vestal vermin unafraid
of the covenant made. ....
draw the blinds on the floors of raw meat
there is murder in the thirst
rich red vascular tapestries
hung in gilded frames of nuns asleep
in dreams where themes of hestiality
are a blessing on their sunday sheep
sermons hang a black gown
over cemetery and sundown
now the clock is harrying midnight
and the ghost of yet to come
will she show rewrites of dark delight
over the sewers we've overrun?
i see a winter palace
cut diamonds at a porcelain neck
when swan lake crushed poor sanity's spirit
as i threw to it bled
we rise with the sun in the underworld
we suffer from a graveless name
we prise wide lids
and wounds with lips curled
over teeth that have tasted shame
we walk this eden, a secret
faces hidden under leonine pride
in dusk's embrace
we find it hard to keep it
when blood and lust and waking world collide
now haranguing grey skies
with revenge upon life
gnathic and sapphic
needs begged gendercide
delusions of grandier denounced the revolt
of descrying cursed glass, disenchanted in vaults
encircled by glyphs midst her sinsistered cult
with hangman's abandon she plied spiritworlds
to archangels in bondage
from light to night hurled
cast down to the earth where torment would unfurl.......
but soon,
her tarot proved
hybrid rumours spread like tumours
would accrue
and blight her stars
to better bitter truths
of cold bloodbaths
as bodies rose
in rigid droves
to haunt her from their
shallow burials imposed
when wolves exhumed
their carthen wombs
where heavy frosts had laboured long
to bare their wounds
to the depths of her soul they pursued
wielding their poison they flew
like a murder of ravens in fugue
and knowing their raptures
would shatter her dreams
she clawed blackened books for damnation's reprieve
baneful cawed canons on amassed enemies
so hallow's eve
as she received
like bellona to the ball
those enemies
fellsisters heaved
her torturies
cross stained flagstones
to her carriage reined to flee
but she knew she must brave the night through
though fear crept a deathshead o'er the moon
like a murder of ravens in fugue
for each masked, jewelled gaze held dread purpose
horror froze painted eyes to cold stares
and even her dance
in the vast mirrors cast
looked the ill of her future
if fate feasted there....
it's just a feeling
i get sometimes
a feeling
sometimes
and i get frightened
just like you
i get frightened too
but it's
no no no no time for heartache
no no no no time to run and hide
no no no no time for breaking down
no no no no time to cry
sometimes in the world as is you've
got to shake the hand that feeds you
it's just like adam says
it's not so hard to understand
it's just like always coming down on
just like jesus never came and
what did you expect to find
it's just like always here again it's
no no no no time for heartache
no no no no time to run and hide
no no no no time for breaking down
no no no no time to cry
everything will be alright
everything will turn out fine
some nights i still can't sleep
and the voices pass with time
and i keep
everything will be alright
everything will turn out fine
some nights i still can't sleep
and the voices pass with time
and i keep
no time for tears
no time to run and hide
no time to be afraid of fear
i keep no time to cry
no no no no time for heartache
no no no no time to run and hide
no no no no time for breaking down
no no no no time to cry
instrumenal
when contrary winds blow across the sands
their murmurs can be easily swayed
but when storms quicken one cannot placate
the howling of their murderous rages
winged seraphim hold love's trembling hand
beside our waiting graves
as war roars about our precious land
seeking cause to subjugate
tonight in flames
tonight the world will fear our names
tonight in flames
stay my feeble hearth
our deaths will be the start
of something glorious and vain
tonight in flames
there is no fanaticism as virile as faith
to the blind his words are clear
suffer not the infidel!suffer not the infidel!
assure your place in paradise here
winged seraphim hold love's trembling hand
beside our waiting graves
i will avenge her, do or damned
her sacred mother did the same
tonight in flames
tonight the world will fear our names
tonight in flames
stay my feeble hearth
our deaths will be the start
of something glorious and vain
tonight in flames
i went to see her dance one day
in play by a wailing wall
now she is gone
but the song lives on
zealous and maniacal
the eastern sword must fall
winged seraphim hold love's trembling hand
beside our waiting graves
as war roars about our precious land
seeking cause to subjugate
tonight in flames
tonight the world will fear our names
tonight in flames
stay my feeble hearth
our deaths will be the start
of something glorious and vain
tonight in flames
earth and sea cower from my screams
as i climb into the skies
atop sins towered heaven high for me
from whence i see no reason why
i should not smite with vengeance
and hurl thieves down from paradise
for storms before were as nothing more
than a breeze next to this night
i am methuselah of the tribulation
the moon child come to harm
a riot of stars, shaken from their station
the chokin' smoke of jerusalem burnin'
six vices become wrath
and though halfblind with ravenin'
like phineus now i see
the end declared from the beginnin'
love won through my defeat
but now i fear i will never peer
on her radiance again
i shall glimpse instead, the slurried red
of faces pressed to bloodstained panes
betrayed and played by god
who alone but he
scapegraced and goated me?
now i wish to piss on his parade
angels, clawed with burnished wings
still loyal, kiss the seal
bent on knees and harrowing
promise overkill
know that you shall die like whores
and the cries of your writhings shall rise
to please their lord, so before the sword
side with me in slaughter
i am methuselah of the tribulation
the moon child come to harm
the spoken horns of desolation
drink the pouring of my fury
those darkened waters spur
the brink of war as judge and jury
and rapist executioner
our time is short, the horsemen ride
a foulbreathed chorea howls, besides
damnation and a day has passed
this divine right to genocide
weld the gates to heaven shut
the abyss leers in hissing ruts
unhilt the black grimoire of death
inscribe all names that god has left
i lived the drams of nymphs and men
but now the nightmares, come again
now the nightmares come again
carrion my name
for those who choose to mouth the curse
a tragic serenade
with judas in my stride
the gothic halls of shame
where statues coldly hold no worse
than the murders i reclaim
from a dark, forsaken time
kissing heaven,spent
he wipes lips free of his hectic discharge
wishing to repent
for the brute that ravaged free
in slight hands beauty weeps
conquest's deep methodical screwing
hurt repeatedly
like the world wound at his feet
dirge inferno
as it is written, damn it
so let it be wrung
from throats of those in overthrow
the past at last has come
a savage bite without respite
pervades the freezing air
this winter chill, grist for his mill
if tears of joy will blear elsewhere
and church bells drown in the cracks of doom
the storms above us hew
as lightning runs like bifurcate tongues
deflowering two by two
hissing, malcontent
he storms the skies on electric discharge
pissing in contempt
on the effigies of the weak
killing all resolve
the great beast simmers, his scarlet women
spit their vitriol
on the terrified face of peace
dirge inferno
as it is written, damn it
so let it be wrung
from throats of those in overthrow
our past at last has come
a hellbound heart, the rose and thorn
have locked to hasten blood
the moon disrobes, to harden droves
of legions pouring
these rivers press, his breath adorns
senates and enemy seats
whilst his power takes as ingratitude
the writhing of the weak
wormwood my name
the poisoned star that fell to earth
and blistered free of shame
in the pits of selfrebirth
now those caves become a garret
overseeing endless barracks
as the waters turn to claret
and the vatican satins burn
through acrid clouds of summer flies
the garden swells with a thousand more wise
forever flung to celestial dreams
clawing at the grave of the dead nazarene
i watch the storm approaching
the darkness calls my name
the trees are growing restless
they feel the season change
their fruit has putrefied
forbidden once and bound to die
the thread of life lies severed
on the brink of paradise
grinning winds of hate unfurled
dash towers tall that grip the sun
talons stretch her veil
reclamation, our time has come
autumn spreads its golden wings
and lays the path for those unseen
a tangled web of evil spun at last
winter spawn from barren thighs
to readdress, to slay the blind
and throw the reins untethered to the skies
they pray to the full moon rising
diana moving with such infinite grace
wrapped alone in a blanket of nightfall
how many secrets can they read by your face?
will they know of majesty
of beauty held in dreamdead sleep
and scarlet seas that bleed the frozen shores?
will their "god" of bridled love
assuage our rule from planes above
or shrink in fear from chaos roused for war?
war!
wrest askew the nails
that have held you, lurking deep
september prayers are waning
burn the shrines of fettered sheep
spearhead the insurrection
of a world that seeks no end
"we are what we are, what we shall be, again..."
appear draped in terror
to the comfort of your kin
stain the milky sunset red
and let the other in...
summer's dying...
biblical choirs soar beyond veiled light
a swansong for ravens trapped flapping in night
a tragic yet magickal fall from grace
too awful to taste for the led and the chaste
those whose long fetters are addressed to all saints
free shining souls torn from giod's given reich
defiled, reviled, exiled from sight
and hell knows we sought victory
chancing the leash
but when bad die were cast
we were cast down to die
a steeple of needles thrust into our eyes
so scholars might say we were blinded by pride
like the sin of our father and the whims of our kind
whom in isaiah and midian thrived
regaining his sights for the storming of skies
and after descenturies have crawled, vilified
our dark harkened day on spread wing now arrives
for eternity is a coprophagic
backward figure head
gorging on her own bitter end
and we have eaten shit
until we're close to addicts
now grime is running out
for us to make amends
to retake what once was lost
to exalt our throne above the stars of god
"to throw our fuck into gates and guts
of a severed neverland
where we, the damned
once pleasured ran
like seamen from the phallus sea"
atrocious oceans must be crossed
to exalt our throne above the stars of god
the thirteenth sign of the zodiac climbs
cowled and scythed to snuff the sunrise
throwing shades of war before like prophecy
nightbreed freed from the vasty deep
nasty reap of freaks forsaken
and when sultry dusk disrobes they'll learn
she is not a natural blonde
for the lower she goes the darker it grows
an eve that blows on her knees for satan
fellated satan
screams congeal in clotted pearl
as he unfurls from aching hibernation
stormbringer drums thunder to full dis orchestra
as lighting streaks with fire
black clouds that shroud the earth
whose cold breasts have held us in scar pillories
but now the sun is loath to come
the crescent moon is freed
elated satan
the scimitar slash to the undergash
of heaven too slight for penetration
we strike as wolves from the thickening fog
to exalt our throne ove the stars of god
lowly holy goats bare the brunt
of rabid dogmas on a stellar bearhunt
bastioned in citadels and monastic cells
that smell of blessed cunt
like a convent where crosses rust
from thirty dirty habits of shaved nun
there where deeper needs are begged of lust
and cess and less impress enough
obtaining the ord of our gaurdian, anger
and death's tunnel vision
bad thing in collision
the locking of eyes and jagged antler
unpicking the seams of fate sewn over dreams
feasting from throats of celestial thieves
and god knows we seek victory
now that we are unleashed
to drive nails home of blind faith through those
who drove us from error to terror below
refugees clung to a crown furred in flies
tarred with red honey, the plaster
of many a spire that aspired to rise
seeking messiahs that by us soon die
in the start like a cast
in morality plays
our hearts wore a mask
of dead rooks in the rain
the world was our cloister
no prayer, bent in shame
our once lucent plumage
stung with horn withered grey
and away
as aeons slew so we grew to myth
revenge accrued to a monolith
bursting through from our roofed abyss
like an aether greased fist
now vulvite gates are so sorely missed
our horror pours through the orifice
where once the spheres and archangels kissed
phallelujah!
fellated satan
his coming assails
the night in gales
that bewail turned tides
that engulf their nation
now divintity is a worm ridden mouth
in a darkened high house
overrun by disease
so let the truth be wrung
that the banished ones intent
on reinstatement have won
we breathe by virtue of their rot
now our souls exult above the stars of god
from the primeval mass
let precious chaos vent
sacred flesh drenched in fornication
beloved by set
may the winds gather her together
from the secrets of men
after thousands of years of terrifying silence
she comes again
all destroyer
the abolition of the yeshua begins...
shattered are the icons of the worthless
the goddess scorned is a valkyrie born
scattered are the wings of the virulent holy
leave their husks to be the prey of vultures and dogs
world without end
cherish the lissome wants of pernicious evil
dusk in her eyes
torn bloody weeping skies
darkness will hasten to devour
and the weak will flee or die
sie sind es die sich
anderlieb festhalten
fuer immer betend auf knien
vor der finisteren goetten
i slay the lamb in the fervour of thine
abandonment unto our lady
with a quenchless thirst for the infinite
for her that exists beyond all knowledge
storming from tired centuries
under the glare of a waxing deathmoon
terrible beauty of love severed
rip the baby from the virginal womb
the blood of jesus
is the wine of the dead
and the drunken angels
bleed with incest
the liliot suckle on her fruitful breasts
and yield the swords that sever and stain
there will be no act or passion wrought
that shall not be attributed to her names
to the name of baphomet:
artemis, bastet, astarte
i yearn to thee who art darkness in thy rising
"weltmacht oder niedergang"
instrumental
instrumental
the needle in the eye of the hurricane
the poison in the font
the nail in the coffin of the profane
i am the lot
maniacal the fire
that weaves inside my soul
when dripping tongues of hate,envenomed,roll
like carpet bombs in vast bazaars
my blood runs with the beasts
though no crescent, cross
or wandering star
shalt witness my defeat
born of jackal in the vatican
to a loathesome flock
i have crept behind the drapes
and a wizard there is not
just a white flag blackened by
singing weapons that have led
a faith that soon dominions over
desert kingdoms of the dead
i smell the fleur do malcontent
the hellish stench
of judas in the dozens
bouquets for greed and twisted law
handmaidens of a holy war
bring on a thousand roses more
i am the thorn
tangled are the thickets
that spare the virgin heart
from the waking grasp of rapists in the dark
mountaineers that strive so far
for a heaven grown from reach
that love herself is fabled
to be missing from their peaks
save in one sole tower
where the presence of a rod
stays the sleeping beauty
from the prying fingers of the mob
i smell the fleur do malcontent
the hellish stench
of judas in the dozens
bouquets for greed and twisted law
handmaidens of a holy war
bring on a thousand roses more
i am the thorn
i am the thorn
i am the spear of longinus
the sword of damocles
kali up in arms, a bleeding sinus
the hammer of the gods in the prophet's teeth
i am the thorn
saint disgustus, president evil
great white hopes of a shark eyed people
lights of the world now flicker and die
impaled in the race. in the paling face
where forked tongues pricked the skies
choking on these words as i slither to their ear
as lightning strikes their blinded minds
i am the thorn
i am not the hand of god...
i am the thorn
i am not the hand of god...
i am the thorn
territorial thieves
ever stealing thunder for religious causes
i will bring you all down to your knees
and fuck you over
bouquets for greed and twisted law
handmaidens of a holy war
bring on a thousand roses more
i am the thorn
i've never been closer
of trying to understand
that certain feeling
carved by another's hand
but it's too late to hesitate
we can't keep on living like this
leave no track
don't look back
all i desire
temptation
keep climbing higher and higher
temptation
adorable creatures
temptation
with unacceptable features
temptation
and trouble is coming
temptation
it's just the high cost of loving
temptation
you can take it or leave it
temptation
but you'd better believe it
you've got to make me an offer
that cannot be ignored
so let's head for home now
everything i'll have is yours
step by step and day by day
every second counts i can't break away
leave no trace
guard your face
full of desire
temptation
keep climbing higher and higher
temptation
and you can take it or leave it
temptation
but you'd better believe it
step by step
and day by day
every second counts
i can't break away
keep us from temptation repeat: x3
lead us not into temptation
trying to find it
temptation
you've got to get up behind it
temptation
put your dime in the hot slots
temptation
but it's a million to one shots
temptation
you think that you're right now
temptation
your gonna make it tonight now
temptation
give me a breakdown
temptation
because it's time for a shakedown
temptation repeat: x16
forgive me father, i have sinned
darkness put her painted claws in me again
her vision drowns like service wine
whispered kisses so divine
i was blessed but now i've come undone
storm clouds roll out overhead
above their master
end of all flesh, end of all days
love predicts disaster
in her precious ways
i was burned, a sacerdotal soul
by the demon queen of my dreams
infatuation turned to total control
her rose was sweet
but her thorns were barbarous
"love me
and worship me
i'll lavish you and ravish you
fulfill all wishes and fetishes too
many never want to see
many never want to know
the truth behind their fantasies
their deepest needs
let alone be shown them"
forgive me father, i have sinned
darkness put her painted claws in me again
her vision drowns like service wine
whispered kisses so divine
i was blessed but now i've come undone
nothing left to do but run
sodom rolls out modern death
on casters ever faster
end of all flesh, end of all days
the stars predict disaster
in her bastard ways
"love me
and worship me
i'll nurture you and hurt you too
fulfill all wishes for my sad aladdin"
she comes to me
like a sandstorm in an hourglass
a whirlwind of desire
i am hypnotized
to think beyond the pale
beyond heartstopping eyes
and sopping thighs
i'm won't to fail
a wicked spell cast over me
addicted to her utterly
despite the horrors that gestate
beneath the beautiful
"i'll grant you life beyond your ken
the envy of all other men
whatever vice will make you spend
eternity with me"
satan's concubine
she makes her crime scenes shine from heaven
forgive me father, i have sinned
darkness put her painted claws in me again
her vision drowns like service wine
whispered kisses so divine
i was blessed but now i've come undone
death, spirit me away
my anguished soul doth strain
on taut and twisted reins
yet, insatiate i still remain
like a proud, unfalled star
that dares thee from afar
to calm my thund'rous heart
else, rend it's knots apart
so i may never sing
of jewelled skies o'er my strings
and love, a wanton thing
can plunge on burnt, black wings
to hang amid the thorns
in scarlet, like velvet worn
about the clouded moon
who wanes in solitude
i am alone
thirsting for the dark
that lurks beneath marbled stone
what black witchcraft
shalt prise thee from thy dreams
and what perverse worldstrategy
will wend it's way with thee from sleep?
"rouse my disease
and with cadent naked dance i shalt teach
thee wisdom of darkness
from earth and red sea
light bearing samael
coalesce with me"
twilight
through pagan city gates
bred shadows play like twining snake
by candlelight
thanateros rites
death seduced and chaos wakes
obsession grips, blindragon fever
in throes of scythed orgasm, eros dies
and saturn rapes faith's lovelorn diva
upon a cyprean altar, stripped bare for sacrifice
virtue births a demon
pandora's box, unhinged, sets loose the night
winged lilith born for want of eden
fanning plumes of harlotry
like pearls before the desert swine
the skies, they darken
and the oceans part
storm forth indignant kraken
reborn venus as thou art
feasting at my banquet
of saturnalia
i call thee having wrestled
the tides from lonely diana
"for thee endymion
i forsake the cerements of this starflung tomb"
bewithus come
unveil the ancient flame
throw the cats our enemies
desire's menstrual strain
eastern devil eyes
a cruel erotic plague
the shekhina is in exile
and the israelites enslaved to shame
midnight
jerusalem
a tenebrous phantasy
revelates to men
their celestial walls crumble
when walks the xul
born to the scarlet whore in babylon
the centuries of wait have all but gone
behold dark beauty stirs to conquer on and on
now worship everything
church bells resounded like judgment day
as they were making love
in the rainswept graveyard
she fucked him hard, silhouetted by flame
a monsoon tigress set upon prey
fall for the love of me
crawl for the love of me
drool for the love of my virulent sway
i grow more master the faster the days
lilith immaculate
this delectable reaper
her eyes were profound
drawing him in deeper
until he was drowned
hurled on the shore
of the world underground
lilith immaculate
mortal kind, a morbid wine
for this dark moon goddess
and freed to stretch her claws
this beautiful whore
would be brutally honest
tortuous one, taboos undone
a glittering star on a sea of myriad waves
and a thickening mist, a seductress
leading lovesick hearts astray
lilith
in the throes of orgasm, she bucked and he broke
at the height of the storm, the chaos they'd smote
burning behind her in arabesque smoke
framed a vision transformed as she sucked from his throat
victoria smiled, her now golden eyes
possessed a regal bearing
of omnipotent power
from wet lips to her smoldering thighs
her beauty perfected and her will agonized
fall for the love of me
crawl for the love of me
drool for the love of my virulent sway
i grow more the master the faster the days
lilith immaculate
with dread single purpose
her mind told him stay
she strode through the fire
desire aflame
she murdered the nuns
in such horrible ways
lilith immaculate
"that night we lay entwined on hay
inside a soldier's barn
her panting breath an opiate
as in her bolder grasp
i caught the scent of desert sands
the holy lands, the fall of reason
but only when i smelt the blood
did i fear her colder hand"
"i am darkness, i am sin
the queen of lust invited in
reborn at last to cast my
fecund shadow on this world,
you shall worship me, enslaved
for many lovers shall i crave
and in return, i'll gladly pave
your psycho path with pearls
for i have been grating
and waiting so long to find
the most perfect hostess close to me
whose thinice troubled mind
was like a cracked, black ornate mirror
to slip right through in time
when at last i wore harmonia's necklace
the cursed twin serpents mine"
tortuous one, debauchery won
the attention of emperors, princes and tsars
for the toll of her kiss, no soul could dismiss
the advance of her throne from afar
this english rose with traits of those
who graced the harems of the east
adorned with thorns, she raised the horns
and scarlet hems to wasted priests
fall for the love of me
crawl for the love of me
drool for the love of my virulent sway
i grow more master the faster the days
lilith immaculate
this delectable reaper
her eyes were profound
they drew him in deeper
until he was drowned
hurled on the shore
of the world underground
lilith immaculate
fall for the love of me
crawl for the love of me
drool for the love of my virulent sway
i grow more master the faster the days
lilith immaculate
the flutes and sweet wine
of her voice anodyne
her power was growing
every hour malign
the truth, lilith's kingdom
drew closer with time
poets racking absinthed brains
could never fully paint these nights
no martyr parting from his pain
could utter words so erudite
as those she now divulged to me
in throes of passions grip
indulging latent fantasies
that ran forked tongues along the lip
of fate's pudenda
the twisted snake's agenda
now the world would bend
to her deadly legacy
life's graveyard was waiting, such dizzying flight
from the convent at all hallows fair
without contemplating, we fled through the night
too blooddrunk and cuntsated to care
the goddess had spoken
and woken desire
it crackled in the air around us
a psychic force shimmering like fire
and on her breasts. that old necklace
the one i snuck from the fucked abbess
whose dirty little secret, other than me
now shone with bold intensity
vast the power it possessed
the darkness brought to living flesh
this treasure was ancient, taken by force
from an elite caste of priests in delphi
the templars were patient, they stayed out the course
then fleeced their greek hosts in their sleep
that necklace traversed
vile murders and miles worse
but what was a curse
to this perverse demoness?
legend swore it was a gift of malice
for the maiden harmonia
the illegitimate spawn of love arid war
jealousy made it gleam for her
for with it clasped, her looking glass
was ever beautiful and young
but disaster choked her royal caste
and every throat on which it hung
there madness, death and horror clung
immortalised in mortal guise
she was a sight for blighted eyes
a plague to gladly plagiarize
and spread like red excited kisses
she was more than me
more than wards
could fulfill in the parlance of the angels
she cast a spell on every cell
in my nobody
she gave me back my tongue
that she might run it on herself
she was lilith. she was light
i was but a parasite
beckoned to temptation
in her velvet overtones
through frozen antics, dressed in white
she led me into paradise
neath comets in ovation
like the queen of winter, throned...
pleasures archetypal
then much rarer agonies
i was a sworn disciple
of her whims and dark decrees
in europe's hair
her spies were everywhere
a sylph amongst the filthy rich and debonair
her greater plan
all chaos and the all of man
for as she fed dark appetites
she bred her children there
the spawn of love and war
presiding over hellfire clubs
archmasons and agharta
the spawn of love and war
she rode the beast. her legs apart
a blazing pyre starter
life's playground elated, such dizzying sights
and sensations ignited her grin
as slaves celebrated her satanic rites
we climbed up to heaven in sin
she came to me
as she will come to you
intoxicating in her seduction
her siren sway. devastating voodoo
persistent, resistance is useless, fool
to this goddess, in lust she's cruel
beyond any measure, her pleasures will found
a perverted eden on sacred ground
vast the power i caressed
the darkness brought to vivid flesh
and in it she now rules a cowered universe
church bells resounded like judgment day
as they were making love
in the rainswept graveyard
she fucked him hard, silhouetted by flame
a monsoon tigress set upon prey
fall for the love of me
crawl for the love of me
drool for the love of my virulent sway
i grow more master the faster the days

the flutes and sweet wine
of her voice anodyne
her power was growing
every hour malign
the truth, lilith's kingdom
drew closer with time
rise, ablaze, libidinous
devildom voyeurs
ascend to smother the light
nascent aeons confer
chaos is spat
from the black eternal sea
serrated mountains of mad shadows
carving towards misdeed
stormchoirs gather
a pestilential hiss
sunset evokes luciferian fire
the skies are ruptured like a knifed orifice
supernal vestments hang tattered
cathedrals shriek to pulpit oratory
invasions scale babel's ivory towers
poised to sodomise a world upon it's knees
victory spent
breathe deep benighted scent
we are as a flame born unto the darkness
desires burning in palatial glades
and virtues once aloof, now worming beneath us
shalt see their children, pleasuring as slaves
attack!
wreak atrocities on those we have despised
judgements be riven, from the skies
darkness empower let us master prophecy
fulfilling destiny the promised fever
bedizens eyes paralysed with blasphemy
written in flesh across the howling ether
artemis
spread the bliss of this lupercalia
with stars erased, throw wide the gates
the infidel soon unmasks her face
neath silken shroud she waxes horn
sharpened to skewer dawn
i am as a plague, born to the priestess
the secret amour of her archangelic rape
jadedeyed when my lovers, possessed
screamed out their agonies, upon the stake
"the most august sorcerers of hades
darkly seized for me a throne
and the upraised scythe so terribly scribed
vengeance in jesuit blood on stone
from this ransacked celestial temple
i hold the prophet's severed head unto all nations"
tremble before us
lords of the starveiled red sepulchres
rushing deathwards, our tartarean fires
kindle pandemonia to furnace the earth
"our voices are opened graves
through which the neverdead escape"
from dank, abyssic dream
pursuing ascendancy
the enemy has held three seasons
imparadised, whilst we writhed
to psychodramas penned by aerial decree
now freed to plunder
heaven torn asunder
evening minuetto in a castle by the sea
a jewel more radiant than the moon
lowered her mask to me
the sublimest creature the gods, full of fire
would marvel at making their queen
infusing the air with her fragrant desire
and my heart reeled with grave poetry
from grace i fell in love with her
scent and feline lure
and jade woodland eyes that ushered in the impurest
"erotic, laden fantasies amid this warm autumn night
she lulled me away from the rich masquerade
and together we clung in the bloodletting moonlight"
pearled luna, what spell didst thou cast on me?
her icy kiss fervoured my neck
like whispering waves 'pon acheron's beach
in a whirl of sweet voices and statues
that phantomed the dying trees
this debauched seductress in black, took me
in a pale azured dawn like ligeia reborn
i tore free of my sleep  sepulchre
on the sea misted lawn where stone figures, forlorn
lamented the spectre of her
bewildered and weak, yet with passion replete
i hungered for past overtures
the curse of unrest and her ardent caress
came much more than my soul could endure
i, at once endeavoured to see her again
stirring from midnight's inertia
knowing not even her name
on a thin precipice over carnal abyss
i danced like a blind acolyte
drunk on red wine, her dead lips on mine
suffused with the perfume of night
for hours i scoured the surrounding grounds
in vain that we might meet
when storm clouds broke, ashened, fatigued
i sought refuge in a cemeterty
sleep, usher dreams
taint to nightmares from a sunless nether
mistress of the dark
i now know what thou art
screams haunt my sleep
dragged from nightmares thou hast wed together
lamia and lemures
spawned thee leche
to snare my flesh
portrait of the dead countess
deep stained pain that i had dreamt
flaunted demise, life's punishment
leaving little strength to seal this wretched tomb
but poised nectar within my stirs
up feverous desire and morbid purpose to search
through cobwebbed drapery to where she swoons
goddess of the graveyard, of the tempest and moon
in flawless fatal beauty her very visage compels
glimpses of a heaven where ghost companies fell
to mourning the loss of god in blackest velvet
enrobed in their downfall like a swift silhouette
"fleeting, enshadowed
thou art privy to my sin
secrets dead, wouldst thou inflict
the cruel daylights upon my skin?
dost thou not want to worship me
with crimson sacrifice
so my cunt may twitch against thy kiss
and weep with newfound life?"
red roses for the devil's whore
dark angels taste my tears
and whisper haunting requiems
softly to mine ear
needfires have lured abominations here
nocturnal pulse
my veins spill forth their waters
rent by lips i cherish most
awash on her perfidious shores
where drowning umbra o'er the stars
ebon's graves where lovers whore
like seraphim and nahemah
"nahemah"
pluck out mine eyes, hasten, attest
blind reason against thee, enchantress
for i must know, art thou not death?
my heart echoes bloodless and incensed
doth temptation prowl night in vulvic revelry
did not the queen of heaven come as devil to me?
on that fatal hallow's eve when we fled company
as the music swept around us in the crisp, fated leaves
under horned diana where her bloodline was sewn
in a graveyard of angels rent in cool marbled stone
i am grieving the loss of life in sombre velvet
enrobed in death's shadow like a swifter
silhouette
at the very start
there were whispers in the dark
and for all the world to see
there was witchcraft at its heart
and on the autumn air
the scent of bonfires everywhere
and a fell wind stirred the leaves
the persecution song
telltale signs of possession
little miss demeanour in the demons bed
gasps she just could not suppress
after lightsout midst the dead
and a past on which sin cast its darts of wickedness
time was running faster for disaster
strange nights were burning
in the furnace of her dreams
a name was uttered, lilith
mistress, playmate, master
such sights were stolen in the throes of ecstasy
and in the thick of all
in the black goddess's thrall
with the wood unseen for trees
victoria stood tall
promiscuous in step
the devil breathing down her neck
as jealous zealots stitched apiece
the persecution song
telltale signs of possession
fickle miss demeanour hissed and disappeared
to her sisters of the cloth
she now reeked of astaroth
again the curse had surfaced
sneaking back the pagan years
weaving webs of great revealing
hidden in the convent
an evil libido abided, undone
breathing, deceiving
feasting on her deviant feelings
she'd clung to her crucifix
once her torturers begun
her screams came quick
the miserichord
den to vice and screw
that had reddened many tongues
wrung symphonies
of suffering from her
many moons hardened pure hearts
those plagued by her black arts
their rooms secreting phantom orgies
vile rites and rifled graves
mere hours, now towered
above this bent and beaten flower
her naked body privy to
the abbess and her ways
victoria fought
no guilt was wrought
just a torrid retort of blasphemies
nails and crosses vomited forth
from this pretty little whore now arched like hell
arched like hell
at the very start
there were whispers in the dark
and for all the world to see
there was witchcraft at its heart
but then the end grew nigh
a dirge inferno filled the sky
in its customary key
the persecution song
telltale signs of obsession
no wailing banshee would dishonor their name
nuns dragged her to the blasted oak
stormclouds threatened holy smoke
they hanged her there like judas
with the hellcat in her reined
time was running faster for disaster
exorcism, torture, gallows
now a shallow grave
a name was stuttered, isaac
tonguetied, simple, bastard
they made him dig the pit
mindless of what it claimed
candelabra snuffed prey  silhouette wedded
nightfall take my hand
seduce me with silky timbred limbs
grant me thy dark command
over the peaks framing tapestries
of thick forest, dusk has filled
with lucifugous kisses enwreathed in mist
creeping like violations from the shadows
to kill
lucretia
is my love in vein
when thy tears bleed sweeter
thank the midsummer rain?
bewinged, infested belfries
toll o'er the sobbing throng
a writhe of lethargic, terrored nudes
whipped and welted neath the barbed windsong
in saddean paradise
ancestral legacies linger on
i am he
the crowned and conquering darkness
satan robed in ecumenical filth
livid bacchus sustained by bridal echelons of sylph
this wintry eve when the snow glistens deep
and sharpened turrets wed the jewelless skies
i shrug off the shroud of preternatural sleep
enbroided by these words malaresia scribed....
"beauty slept and angels wept
for her immortal soul
in this response, all evil chose
to claim her for their very own"
carpathia
the pleasured dead speak of her
in necromantic tongue
when ambered daylights are done
masterbating in their graves
on her zenith to come
this catafalque night when awed stars report
their absence from the heavenly brow
crippled seraph shalt cower in illustrious courts
whilsts the cloaked maelstrom resounds throughout
"how the storm it fulfills
my heart though unhealed
celestial knives ebonied
and wild woods thrill
yet far fiercer still
her lustre eviscerates me"
carpathia
priapic lovers twist in concert with her
covenants are struck, jagged lightning fellates
the path towards the castle weary innocence takes
i rule as master here
where feral hordes impart my temper
love sank wounded when i, betrayed
saw death etch cruelly, upon my lineage
"usher the spite seething draconist
and commit this world to thy ancient
sovereignty"
erunescent veil descend
psalmed sunset thus portends
and laid to rest, i now am blessed
with this darkness, forever more
supreme vampiric evil
when the sun has wept upon the waveless lake
and the mists steal in with ease
covened wolves are their eerie dissonant napes
in adoration of the moon and thee
"they call as i to thee"
and i will come, as if in dream
my languid, dark and lustrous malaresian queen
of vengeful, ancient breed
gilded with the pelts of many enemies
erishkigal, ravenhaired
thy seduction haunts the castle in erotic despair
i can taste thy scent by candlelight
legs of porcelain traced and laced to their lair
appease the beast on spattered sheets
dyed unearthly red as sobriety weeps
nocternity
she shall come for me
a black velvet painting sprung to elegant life
like a poignant madonna perverted to night
and i have ridden from the westerning light
to expend my lust
tear away the funereal dress
know that i will escape from my death
surrendered to the splendour of her sharpened caress
lo! the pale moonlight
weaves a poetic spell of vital death and decline
of mist and moth and the hunger inside
kisses took to fever and the fever, demise
"through twilight, darkness and moonrise
my scarlet tears will run
as stolen blood and whispered love
of fantasies undone"
countess swathed in ebony
and snowwhite balletic grace
rougefilmed lips procure the wish
for lust and her disgrace
dusk and her embrace
we shall flirt through the shadows
like a dream of werewolves in the snow
under deadly nightshade
still warmed with the kill's afterglow
beneath the stars thy flesh bedevils me
beneath the stars taste the death in me
bequeath to me thy fiery kiss
to sever thin mortality
elizabeth
my heart is thine
thy fragrant words warm within like wine
"let me come to thee
with eyes like asphodel
moonglancing, loose desires free
to writhe under my spell"
ereshkigal, ravenhaired
thy seduction haunts the castle in erotic despair
i know thy scent by candlelight
immortal flesh i yearn to share
appease the beast on spattered sheets
dyed malefic red as sobriety weeps
nocternity
she shall come for me
unfurl thy limbs breathless succubus
how the full embosomed fog
imparts the night to us
forgive me father, i have sinned
darkness put her painted claws in me again
her vision drowns like service wine
whispered kisses so divine
i was blessed but now i've come undone
storm clouds roll out overhead
above their master
end of all flesh, end of all days
love predicts disaster
in her precious ways
i was burned, a sacerdotal soul
by the demon queen of my dreams
infatuation turned to total control
her rose was sweet
but her thorns were barbarous
"love me
and worship me
i'll lavish you and ravish you
fulfill all wishes and fetishes too
many never want to see
many never want to know
the truth behind their fantasies
their deepest needs
let alone be shown them"
forgive me father, i have sinned
darkness put her painted claws in me again
her vision drowns like service wine
whispered kisses so divine
i was blessed but now i've come undone
nothing left to do but run
sodom rolls out modern death
on casters ever faster
end of all flesh, end of all days
the stars predict disaster
in her bastard ways
"love me
and worship me
i'll nurture you and hurt you too
fulfill all wishes for my sad aladdin"
she comes to me
like a sandstorm in an hourglass
a whirlwind of desire
i am hypnotized
to think beyond the pale
beyond heartstopping eyes
and sopping thighs
i'm won't to fail
a wicked spell cast over me
addicted to her utterly
despite the horrors that gestate
beneath the beautiful
"i'll grant you life beyond your ken
the envy of all other men
whatever vice will make you spend
eternity with me"
satan's concubine
she makes her crime scenes shine from heaven
forgive me father, i have sinned
darkness put her painted claws in me again
her vision drowns like service wine
whispered kisses so divine
i was blessed but now i've come undone
he would rise triumphant
all done up
on a plume of raven wings
trafficking with sycophants
sharing his cup
amidst other graver things
alchemists and sorcerers stitched his head
with the stench of pitch and myrrh
the devout faded out but the pagan remained
the candles burnt low and still nothing came
bearing golden secrets from a cold malevolent race
he would have his demon!
he would have his vice!
all save his soul was up for sacrifice!
despite their raising not a single hair
everything stank of witchcraft there
from the stained chapel to the statued lawn
in caprineum on the lake
to the still lit crypts and the slit of dawn
sliding down the towers, it all smelt fake
he needed answers not advice
intending to devise
a lengthy train of torture for the fool
who thought a seance would suffice
or sighted, furred in dragonflies
the signature of satan on a wall
sweetest maleficia
planchette to blanchet, from ghosts to a priest
returning with a spider for the poisonous feast
the italian astrologer prelati, spinning sin
his fingertips were scented with
the tears from seraphim cheeks
part glamor and a hammer
cadaverous and glib
commanding in a voice of frozen peaks
he would have his demon!
he would have his gold!
out of control gilles' soul was sold
under mistletoe and the glistening snow
kissing in the shadow of abandoned saviors
from the banquet hall to the stable gates
a graveyard shift in tone
sank upon the castle, like a papal weight
or a deep philosophical stone
the air was sick with trepidation
despair and desperation
then he fixed his covenant in blood
now all was rich and tapestried
fragrant wine to shitty mead
his new world opened with a claret flood
time was right, this wretched night
to etch the circles clear again
as a labyrinth of razors led a blind man to the stars
so too prelati brought the dark
it's name was barron, eyes like catastrophic tar
imbibed with fire
they fed him shredded infants on an altar full of scars
entangled in a dream
the mirrors full of steam
he scarce could see joan's face reflecting through
his last attempt to grasp at god
lay blackened in a holy fog
and now there were only devils to pursue
gilles was wrapped in a velvet spell
of hell and her seductions
the assassinated days as a caesar gone by
barron, spitting acid, as his magical guide
lit demonic pyres where once dying embers writhed
sweetest maleficia
aching floorboards spoke my name
in the belly of the beast to foreign shores
in tune with tides that whispered fame
and fortune for our humble lord
ecclesiastical banners unfurl in the manner
of those who seek conquest and gain
sail forth for outremer
the promised land prised from the hands of blasphemers amassing there
awakened from the desert sands capes
onward christian soldiers
fated nazareth and bethlehem
have fallen to an enemy bolder
it is said to widespread slaughter and rape
we are all sinners, enslaved to the cross
god wills the great war to erase
the judaic acres, the mohammedans
in defence of our revenant faith
political prowess takes to the stage
a pilgrimage led bu the sword
the sweet maiden blast of our clarion rage
against the foul heretic hordes
heretic hordes
the blazing invader crusader parade
vatican sanctioned and mammon adored
now, papalled to die
the fatal battle cry
a natural army vies for stretching christendom
wide, we slay the infidel
remiss our way to hell
pay well the wishing well
with golden martyrdom
with golden martyrdom
with golden martyrdom
scaling the towers with power ordained
dark flowers of infamy bud
ransacking, hacking off saracen reign
the temple drinks claret in floods
mercy forgotten in our illgotten gain
of women and innocent blood
death abides in this domain of ashes
the streets are stained with the butchered foe
now i hear the bells of triumph ringing
as they lay there rotting in their thousand shrouds
beneath the clouds that skitter and scatter
dispersions on the truth of heaven
we are all sinners, enslaved to the cross
god wills the great war to erase
the judaic acres, the mohammedans
in defence of our revenant faith
no crescent moon
no prophet of doom
shall wail above jerusalem
vast hypocrites
all grasping for glitz
have taken the mount and the tomb
here in the kingdom of loss
here in the kingdom of loss
here in the kingdom of loss
lead to the river
midsummer, i waved
a ?v? of black swans
on with hope to the grave
all through red september
with skies firepaved
i begged you appear
like a thorn for the holy ones
cold was my soul
untold was the pain
i faced when you left me
a rose in the rain
so i swore to the razor
that never, enchained
would your dark nails of faith
be pushed through my veins again
bared on your tomb
i am a prayer for your loneliness
and would you ever soon
come above unto me?
for once upon a time
from the binds of your lowliness
i could always find
the right slot for your sacred key
six feet deep is the incision
in my heart, that barless prison
discolours all with tunnel vision
sunsetter
nymphetamine
sick and weak from my condition
this lust, a vampyric addiction
to her alone in full submission
none better
nymphetamine
nymphetamine, nymphetamine
nymphetamine girl
nymphetamine, nymphetamine
my nymphetamine girl
wracked with your charm
i am circled like prey
back in the forest
where whispers persuade
more sugar trails
more white lady laid
than pillars of salt
keeping sodom at night at bay
fold to my arms
hold their mesmeric sway
and dance to the moon
as we did in those golden days
christening stars
i remember the way
we were needle and spoon
mislaid in the burning hay
bared on your tomb
i am a prayer for your loneliness
and would you ever soon
come above unto me?
for once upon a time
from the binds of your lowliness
i could always find
the right slot for your sacred key
six feet deep is the incision
in my heart, that barless prison
discolours all with tunnel vision
sunsetter
nymphetamine
sick and weak from my condition
this lust, a vampyric addiction
to her alone in full submission
none better

nymphetamine girl
nymphetamine, nymphetamine

all saints day, the taint of rain
blood and mud and thunder all the same
to those who close their ranks to gille's men
bricqueville, prelati and de sille
creatures of the dark creeping up and down the countryside
little angles out to pasture once again
torture garden rules of thumb apply
to sacred flesh and the naked eye
golgothic this erotica
stinking of honey and worse, sulfur
so black was the magic in this tragical kingdom
the superstitions grew
wise to the wolves that surprised their children
gagged in sacks and dragged back to
tiffauges
it's roads now home to a beautiful stranger
lifting her veil
spinning her lies
tender eyes, neverending danger
it grows
a rose that chose death for it's bedmuck
prickles in wait
thanking her spies
trickling thighs her only hiccup
and though she walks the forest trails
she's far from innocent or frail
she leads them down the path where darkness dwells
that night is rife with celebration
the tower sings
where so much foul illumination
strikes a lighthouse for the things
that slither and slather at the border of the pentagram
mid sour dreams
a beauty pageant for the gathering damned
of slaughtered lambs and tortured screams
praeclarum
custodem
ovium
lupum
torture garden rules of thumb apply
to sacred flesh and the naked eye
golgothic this erotica
stinking of honey and worse, sulfur
so black was the magic in this tragical kingdom
in this castle of loupgarou
when moonstruck veins, inflamed, deranged on
a parcel of victims now tied to
tiffauges
engorged on the hordes of the anorexic
cherubim forced
naked and blind
a holocaust mind designed their exit
a libertine so grim
sometimes tore them limb from limb
slitting their throats
pissing on graves
jesus save but the devil made him
praeclarum
custodem
ovium
lupum
the evening air laps thick about
the stagnant moat that tiffuages claims
as dusk now slips away
where taught to run, the rotten tongue
of a hotter gtterdmerung
has started licking like a flame
whispers in the dismal mist
are full of crystal promises
black rites begun in earnest
ignite hell's hungry furnace
behold the bold inauguration of the dark side
demonic passions climbing
i'llfated stars aligning
tonight these sights are guaranteed to feed the master
the tide of blood is rising
his gifts will be providing
unmasked, the phantom lord de rais
haunts the furthest tower
wherein death has sucked the hour
there, throttled gasps tantamount for foreplay
and drooling razors next to come
unspool red secrets from the young
the moon grinned full, the games were chaste
when the children first arrived
now midnight shadows crawl apace
to darken council with their lives
flesh and ecstasy as sport
are immortal vices of the highest order
wherein devilry holds sway
behold blind walls where these cockatrice squalled
their songs of necronomicon
spoke out of gilles de rais
each murdered son, each frozen rose
handpicked, was gently fed
to the sumptuous one in black and those
whose lives where thrown in with the dead
the candles lit, the stage was set
as it was in sainted days
when censers swung and banners hung
on the siege of orleans on the painted seine
now the castle floats in the drifting fog
torn from it's moorings
like a shipwreck dredged from hell
as innocents entreat a shiffing god
their voices soaring
on a silver tide to heaven
on a knife edge as they fell
the blade would plunge in virulent arcs
such wounds would stretch away
by the fireside, warmed to creative sparks
of the monster gilles de rais
gilded gilles de rais
comets vomited
the restless bells of crime
peeled black skin from broken bones
of angels cut from the nicks of time
festering faces with painted eyes
the prettiest kept to be thrust inside
gaping necromantic from the mantleside
caked in kissed goodbyes
days faded in decay
the stench of perfume lied
no horror in the glades of man
was left for barrom to provide
so unique was the beat of his poisoned heart
and it's sordid, morbid crack
no further atrocity could possibly surpass
unrewarded, bored, he turned his burning back

if this world is wearing thin
and you're thinking of escape
i'll go anywhere with you
just wrap me up in chains
but if you try to go alone
don't think i'll understand
stay with me
stay with me
in the silence of your room
in the darkness of your dreams
you must only think of me
there can be no in between
when your pride is on the floor
i'll make you beg for more
stay with me
stay with me
you'd better hope and pray
that you make it safe
back to your own world
you'd better hope and pray
that you'll wake one day
in your own world
cause when you sleep at night
they don't hear your cries
in your own world
only time will tell
if you can break the spell
back in your own world
stay with me
stay with me
stay, stay with me
stay, stay, stay, stay, stay
stay with me
here sat babylon
fattened by the purses of the worst and wrong
where the decadent tastes of hell grew strong
like a curse upon
this tragic kingdom
dusk descended like a final curtain
on this stage only death was certain
singing through the turrets
like a velvet serenade
played near a grave
sentries and gentry, afforded the bloom
of a red setting sun and a bloodletting moon
applauded, then accorded them
portents of doom
almost too soon
they pissed upon the winds
that rocked the cradles
laughing over those hovels grovelling to wolves
they kissed and sinned
under overstocked tables
as the world outside grew sodden and mauled
here sat babylon
fattened by the purses of the worst and wrong
where the decadent tastes of hell grew strong
like a curse upon
this tragic kingdom
gilles sat sipping damson absinthe
from a goblet made of bone
as lightning ripped and danced upon
the flagstones
wayward fantasies marched on home
now the treetops bowed to whisper
in a thin disney veneer
they knew the howls so exquisitely honed
were those of children, disappeared
they'd listened to the winds
heard the murdered abel
rechristened in the stone jaws of tiffauges
where the list of sins
grew beyond a fable
they now roared abroad, restless with debauch
restless with debauch
restless with debauch
this tragic kingdom
would see god's angels walk
away
satanic, enigmatic
his black magic was ecstatic
megalomaniac in titanic displays
dressed in the best
wicked britches of the west
he cut a mourning figure in glorious swathe
but all his nightmares would come true
drowning in a stream of unbounded pleasure
here sat babylon
fattened by the purses of the worst and wrong
where the decadent tastes of hell grew strong
like a curse upon
this tragic kingdom
like a curse upon
this tragic kingdom
the moon bleared through the skeletal trees
averting her face from congenital deeds
thus eves grew murky, haunted, grieved
about this place laced with demon seed
blanchet, a priest, his book of lies
exonerated him from gilles' crimes
announced his fears, one night of sighs
a night for cursing nursery rhymes
in the light of the fire wrestling feckless shadows
gilles' frightening wealth, his tightening grip
on the weak and the rubies that his coffers let slip
steered to near ruin in successive years
of the most of excess and the best of it here
in the light of the fire wrestling reckless shadows
reigning at the feast of phantasia
heightened pleasures were endeavored to bow
before my coronation and vocal aspirations
to rule this fool creation fallen neath me now
i knew deep eyes of a distant christ
were scarred from afar under starry luster
sighting my recitals on the rites of vice
perverting virtue, enslaving grace
behind the glittering mask of pride
saving face finding thorns to pierce his side
desire, the fire, spread hell throughout my soul
and higher the wire, the more i sought control
straining from the leash in exultation
head to the wind to breathe with ravenous lungs
the global scent of fornication
a writhe of many vipers deciphering tongues
i whispered schemes to dreamers then to pursue an eden
that screamed of me supreme again
as my world bloomed so too the moon
through adam to seth, enos, cainan
mahalaleel and jared blew
perverting virtue, enslaving grace
behind the slippery guise of lies
saving face making waves to drown their faith
messiahs, pariahs, eons reversed the two
thus, higher their sprites the more cursed grew their roots
and suffering i swept cruel seas
on the galley of the shadow of death
a fist in the cunt of the spread horizon
a kiss for the sun risen red once dined on
the coast of menses, discharged from celestial wombs
a first degree murder of ravens
followed in fugue through the crack of doom
the goat of mendes, i set regime
in the galley of the shadow of death
angels in raiments as pure as coal
taking their payments in tortured mortal souls
a bold direction, the abyss edge
but on cold reflection, one they warmed to nonetheless
as they preyed the paths of the righteous
through the myth of thistled orchard floors
bearing gifts of plenitude for
the apples of the lord were rotten to the core
temptation, my ambassador
attila, herod, pharisees and nero all begged of me for more
down dark steps of history, i waged a war with a heaven
i could not see beyond my wildest fantasies
throwing sixes over deadly sin, i traded those who played to win
skin for precious skin and that that wormed within
staining the reams of revelation
etching everafters in accursed verse
the limpid rags of resurrection
from papal parapets were to dirt dispersed
desire, the flyers spread hell throughout their souls
and higher the fire, the more i held control
eclipsing violent centuries
like a dark scar over france
enter the nascent gilles de rais
a warrior and a scholar
he fought for joan of arc
before she met with martyrdom in flames
far from fairytale
a deaths head on his sail
a light that would not fail
beneath her spell
but the crucifix was veiled
when his decadence prevailed
in a drench of red regaled
he was shat out of hell
shat out of hell
frozen in iniquity
a passion for awe in an age of grief
his wealth and power led him on
to the tainted gates of babylon
born beneath the howling stars
in a shower of golden lys
a wolfcub with the world between his sabre teeth
torn between extremes of faith
the pious and the priests
he fed the devil children like he threw his mastiffs meat
far from fairytale
the coffin and the nail
descending to the pale
under the spell
of alchemists who failed
to clench the menstrual grail
in a drench of red regaled
he was shat out of hell
shat out of hell
grown so morbid without war
the wine corrupted, nightmares spored
his lord's betrayal, played no more
he beat upon the devil's door
demanding pleasures to replace
joan of arc, her epic grace
had set aflame his wolf heart with her truth
and when she died, his life of pride
was lost to god and in his crimes
he turned to raising satan with the proof
soon nightly, unsightly
offerings were made on a vulgar altar
and slowly, but surely
the darkness answered like a falling star
far from fairytale
insanity exhaled
a fullblown winter gale
under it's spell
innocents assailed
were entered and impaled
in a drench of red regaled
he was shat out of hell
shat out of hell
perverse, seductive, cruel as sin
an egotist, he mourned
both war and glory, schooled to win
whatever bored imagination spawned
where will you be they tense for warfare?
what will you see with your innocence there?
where will you be my darling?
where will you be they tense for warfare?
where will you be when god is glorifying?
there we will be between the dead and dying
where will you be my darling?
where will you be when god is glorifying?
prophecies and glory forge a massive disdain
for lying passive in the shadows whilst the enemy reigns
devoted to the votive, holy standard above
"by command of the king of heaven"
came the death of love
where will you be when they're vilifying?
how will they see when the truth is blinding?
where will you be my darling?
where will you be when they're vilifying?
where will you be when the dark is rising?
how will you keep from it's terrorizing?
where will you be my darling?
where will you be when the dark is rising?
burning was the sunset like a portent of doom
on the saintly iron maiden as she fell from her wound
but visions and ambition
never listened to submission
and she was on a mission from the highest above
to lord upon the slaughter
like a sword through hissing water
she arose where archers sought her
for the death of love
the righteous death of love
gilles adored her drama
her suit of pure white armor
blazed against the english in a torrent of light
and as they rallied onto night
a cancer fled his soul
dissolving
framed amid the thick of fire
aflame, a valkyrie
she made him click without desire
and in his eyes she swam a goddess
and even when they caught her breath
her words would leave a scar
"for only in the grip of darkness
will we shine amidst the brightest stars"
how will you breathe when their wheels are turning?
how will you know if the sky is burning?
where will you be my darling?
how will you breathe when their wheels are turning?
where will you be when babel builds my fire?
will you not flee and label me pariah?
where will you be my darling?
where will you be when they light my pyre?
aligned with joan in all
that was enthroned and divine
he swore to score the crimes
jackdaws poured on this dove
crimes he knew alone
derived from minds of the blind
the church unfurled for murder perched
upon the death of love
framed amid the thick of fire
aflame, a valkyrie
she claimed the skies were lit with spires
and in his eyes she swam a goddess
and even when she fought for breath
her words would leave a scar
"for only in the grip of darkness
will we shine amidst the brightest stars"
what would happen if i go?
just leave without any reason why?
would someone wonder why? would someone miss me?
what would happen if i couldn't take it?
just break without any signs up front
would someone pick it up?
would someone help me out?
'cause life ain't easy for me
ain't easy alone
this is my path, it's lonely
what would happen if i change?
just wake up one day not quite the same
would someone wonder why? would someone know how i was before?
would they like me better knowing i am not the one i was
what would happen if i lie?
ground is shaking
waves are breaking
the wind has lost control
the air is shifting while
it's lifting force fools gravity
a huge eruption
vast explosions
as it bursts the earth
water's pounding
waves are sounding
deadly and extreme
"but we are equally destructive"
equally destructive as we are
don't you think we've also gone too far?
we are just a part of this machine
and it's endless stream
alarming silence predicts
the violence that is yet to come
we are senseless
proud while blindness
is catching up with us
we must measure while
the pressure of nature's force expands
we feel minor, punished and meager
betrayed by all our gods
"we are a part of it
we are equally destructive"
equally destructive as we are
don't you think we've also gone too far?
we are just a part of this machine
and its endless stream
nemo mihi obloquatur impune
ex cathedra
a deo ipso verba mea ad vos proveniunt
non obsequentes exsecratio condemnabit
subicite fato vestro et obtemperate
child this is the world through square eyes,
i can see fiction like it's real
window to an unknown paradise
a paradise where no one sees
i wish i saw it all,
a paradise where no one knows,
all these images for real, the reality
it's a seduction, like a dream
i can feel pain, i feel the blood
out of your hands but in your minds
the fire of the burning fight
i wish i saw it all, i feel love as a disease,
all these images for real, in my fantasy
contemplative good or evil, right or wrong
find yourself between the dying crowd, the blooded streets
how can't this affect a mind
how can't this affect a pure, young heart
child in my own world it's getting worse
it's never good enough for them
learn this, do that, do as we say
as if results are all there is
it doesn't affect me much, i cannot be more than i am,
the screen shows me enough, face reality
i can play i'm strong and tough
and let them feel who should be blamed
fighting and killing for new lives
a way to learn how to survive
i can play on and on, it ends up just the same again
but my life is not a game, life should be a game
contemplative good or evil, right or wrong
find yourself between the dying crowd, the blooded streets
how can't this affect a mind
how can't this affect a pure, young heart
child hope is fragile,
and all there is to make them see i'm not that bad
hope is the last reason not to flee, not to run away
into the tempting square world of fantasy, free me
oh, free me
hate is an impulse
your aversion, my reason
contemplative games, movies, things a child should not see
a flash see, but you won't forget
a game play, play and hear and see, again
it marks the heart and spills our youth
child i'm in the world of square minds
the beauty of a clearer world
fighting a game, its name is life
the game of life is hard to fight
i've shot my hate today, you'll know the causes when it's too late
its embodiment has paid, feel reality
the pictures say more than you see
why should i see what you've told me
nothing gets worse, it stays the same
the same is killing, anyway
i wish i saw it all, so could you please let me escape
all these images for real from reality
contemplative good or evil, right or wrong
find yourself between the dying crowd, the blooded streets
how can't this affect a mind
how can't this affect a pure, young heart?
what do they see when they look at me?
who are they to judge me
if they never spoke with me?
never looked without laughing
never tried to see, see me
i can't believe that it is only me
the person to hate,
the only left out
i can't believe how they can be so mean
if they could feel the brutal stings of their words,
and the bitter cold when they laugh
once more i'm running
running away, i must hide
can't take anymore
a fight to free me from an endless struggle with life
running, tell me how far should i go
if they're all the same
this fight...
i am fighting my way through
i don't really want to be like them
the way they behave,
the way that they live
i don't really need someone
no people like that,
but someone in a world with warmth and respect
a world without the feeling
bewildered by silence
stuck by its questions and lucid ways to make us aware
i did not know how cruel that could be
that so many cases will never be solved
that so many stories will never be told
i did not know how cruel that could be
fighting a war that rages inside
the world can't see the hate that burns in there
how can we face what lies beneath,
if we just fear and don't fight back?
how many questions left unanswered?
how many tears and inner strength shall we need?
how any times can we encounter this again and again?
how many things exist that blind us?
how many forms of brutal violence can we see?
how many images of pain will make us numb
so hard, so cruel, we fail to see, we fail to feel?
so afraid, even without thecourage of despair?
fighting a war that rages inside
the world can't see the hate that burns in there
how can we face what lies beneath,
if we just fear and don't fight back?
afraid of ourselves, arfaid to stand up
i did not know how cruel that could be
we failed to see, we failed to feel
still afraid, what if you love someone?
what if this happened to your loved ones?
what would you do if you were there at that time?
what makes you act like nothing happened?
nothing's wrong, you're doing fine?
what makes you think you are immune to this?
what drove us so far to the edge of tolerance?
if judging and accusing is so easy, then why
why still?
fighting a war that rages inside
the world can't see the hate that burns in there
how can we face what lies beneath,
if we just fear and don't fight back?
there's no time for us
there's no place for us
what is this thing that builds our dreams
yet slips away from us
who wants to live forever
who wants to live forever
there's no chance for us
it's all decided for us
this world has only one sweet moment set aside for us
who wants to live forever
who wants to live forever
who dares to love forever
oh ooh woh, when love must die
touch my tears with your lips
touch my world with your fingertips
and we can live forever
and we can love forever
forever is our today
who wants to live forever
who wants to live forever
forever is our today
who waits forever anyway?
energize me with a simple touch
or with an open heart
energize me, fire up this flame
that's burning between us
it's not a fantasy
another mystery
it's just what i can feel
and something i can see
it's like a memory
and in a melody
it's just what we all know
and we all hear
i was blind
i was closed down
could not feel
or set it free
energize me with a simple touch
or with an open heart
energize me, fire up this flame
that's burning between us
it lies in everyone
this swalling energy
it's all around us too
electrifying you
so can't you set it free?
this virtue is the key
just something we all know
and we are used
i can feel
it's inside me
open up
enlighten me
energize me with a simple touch
or with an open heart
energize me, fire up this flame
that's burning between us
energize me with a simple smile
open up your mind
energize me activate that light
that's given and taken
can you believe in the power that's burning between us?
would you believe if you open up your mind
open up your mind
energize me with a simple touch
or with an open heart
energize me, fire up this flame
that's burning between us
energize me with a simple smile
open up your mind
energize me, fire up this flame
that's burning forever
instrumental
after forever
boundaries are open
i see clearly all my dreams
i know chance is always near
make my own reality
just imagine!
boundaries are open
'cause you cannot control this
my reality differs from yours
the power of imagination is strong
so we only try to imagine
will the force be so strong it will control one's mind?
will this power delude or widen the madness that renders blind?
so the frontiers of our conceit
then will become indistinct to vanish in thin air
boundaries are open
but don't believe it's real!
so does faith have roots in imagination?
who is right in the grim and endless fight for revelation?
i cannot tell what's right or wrong
for we all dwell in an imaginary borderland
boundaries are open
but don't believe it's real
boundaries are open
but don't believe it's real
child hello father, hello mother
there is so much i don't get
please don't be mad at me i will try harder,
i'll really do the best i can
mother that's not enough
you're the cause of my domestic captivity
child and i will close my eyes and fantasize
of a world that's not so cold
mother that's how it will be
suffer the causes of my personal misery
i've sacrificed my beauty,
my freedom, my dreams,
the independent me
child hello father, hello mother
don't blame me for things i didn't do
yes, i will go now and i'll be silent
please stop your screaming, and love me
mother that's all you can see
speak of love while you've ruined
what's meant to be
child and then i'll close my eyes
to fantasize of a world
where i can be free
and free to be
contemplative sinner or righteous,
the line is so thin
can you condemn it
can you be the one to judge it all
or accuse yourself if the sentence is your life?
child hello father, hello mother
forgive me for standing in your way
i just wanted someone who'd hold me and listen,
are these illusions, are they
mother only fantasies?
imagine how my life could have been
i would still have my beauty,
my freedom, my dreams,
the independent me
contemplative our course in life is a path we must take alone
no one can choose what to do,
only you, so the sins we commit are the struggles within
there is no judge to decide what is right, what is wrong
tell me, can you live in freedom
knowing that your choice hurt someone
father once we had a life and now we have you
the saviour of love is a catastrophe
i'll leave you both if i must give up my dreams
my chances aren't here with you
i won't be chained because of this
the sins of all, the sinner in me
i follow my dreams, you call it blasphemy
if my ideals are sins
to me they are the strength within
then i shall stay a sinner
child i can be free
and free to be
contemplative sinner or righteous,
the line is so thin
can you condemn it
can you be the one to judge it all
or accuse yourself if the sentence is your life?
why can't they see?
they're to blame, i can't forgive
it left a permanent mark behind,
my weakness, my strength
i'm waiting for the perfect sign
to reveal what lies inside
there's no lie in trying,
why do you fear me?
why can't you see?
there's neither blame nor forgiveness
be strong by being susceptible,
and don't quail your frankness is your strength
and shows their weakness
i'm  your waiting for the perfect sign
to reveal what lies inside
there's no lie in trying
why do you fear me?
why should i fear you?
an open heart is just as confronting as honesty!
why can't i forgive?
you must stop to condemn the past
why can't this fear be my guide?
it will be your strength if you dare
there's no blame in my life
nor forgiveness for the pain
i will show them!
let them know who you are!
this is myyour perfect revelation
somehow everything's getting worse
my fight is just one of their struggles
and have i ssen it all oh no,now their hate's reaching the top
and guess who's to blame,and guess who's responsible
if pain is our line,
the one that connects us in life,should we hold on
i only feel their shame when i'm near
life should be more than this,should be warmer than this
cause there's more grief and pain,oh yes
there is more than what i caused,
things beyond me
and their eyes reflect things they'll never say out loud
if pain is our line,
the one that connects us in life,should we hold on
our dreams,ambitions and passion
our plans for the future,our combined goals
a life with status,respect and adoration
our wishes and hope destroyed at once
without those things to connect us,
a life together is even worse than alone
we all need two sides of the story
two sides,one can become a reflection
of the truth,a lie
you'll be judging soon
two sides,they both have their emotions,opinions and thoughts
on who's to blame on reality,can you tell
if pain is our line
the one that connects us in lief,should we hold on
weak and frightend
paralyzed and naked
they are children running for their lives
lives are taken
terrorists mistaken for they use the young ones
as refined living shields
pain and deep fear
hostage in an ancient rage between people torn by their ideals
willing to die, willing to kill
hopeless and blind in their world where innocence dies
weak and frightend
paralyzed and naked
they are children running for their lives
lives are taken
terrorists mistaken for they use the young ones
as refined living shields
rage and deep hate
isolated in an ancient war with people not so different from you
willing to fight, willing to try to win an endless battle of
pride
while innocents die
and then we see them running
see the world is watching this
and we can only try to understand what causes it
and then we see the living
see then crying for their dead
are we the ones to understand how crazy pain can get
some people turn in circles
they can never break it through
some people lost their lives before they died
and now they want it back!
loss and deep grief
engulfed in an ever present pain, ancient in practice
weak and frightend
paralyzed and naked
they are children running for their lives
lives are taken
terrorists mistaken for they use the young ones
as refined living shields
i'm in a spiral of thoughts,the past,the pain, it all comes back
i see but now i see more,even feel their side of this tale
i realize their fate,no one's to blame, two sides
my life's a mirror that no one sees
so if i could show them my own vision to this world
my life's a mirror i need them to see,
so they would open up to me and fill up my emptiness
i still really try to feel, a strange experience to enter the other side
i feel there's so much we never said
it's all misunderstood, the emotions that we had
my life's a mirror that no one sees,
so if i could show them my own vision to this world
my life's a mirror i need them to see
voice in the back of her head
maybe if you would have the guts to open up
maybe the world would do the same,maybe,maybe
you can still be a part of this world,still be the queen of the ball
not of your own empty paradise where no one sees the beauty inside
face the world outside my safe shell
i must face reality for once
i've never felt the passion of a warm life
games, tv, i know they're not real, they're just a substitute
this could mean
the breaking point in these three lives
the moment of insight that could change their misfortune
let this help be enough to make it
let this be stronger than pain,the ancient wall between love and the comprehension
that will lead to the inner forgiveness
a reflection outside the circle of your life is all you should seek
an empty gaze reflects the contradiction
alleged strength, so fragile
no more than compassion
ephemeral gatherings without interaction
be sincere and announce your departure
a vallum of fairy tales smashed into reality
projected on the ruins of a castle in the air
i see your pain i see it grow
slowly inside you
you cannot control it
the hurting's ruthless, you cannot win
i see every smile you fake
strong emotion, strong devotion to ignore the pain
to stand strong
day after day, to be there for us, always
to pretend there's nothing wrong
how you feel or how it feels
no words describe it
your body feels like a stranger
we cannot stop it, we cannot win
i see every smile you fake
strong emotion, strong devotion to ignore the pain
to stand strong
i see every smile you fake
strong emotion, strong devotion to ignore the pain
to stand strong
every painful day, i'll be there for you, always
and together we will stand strong
my decision is fixed
the suitcases are packed
i'm laying the letter on the table
tonight, i will be safe and the fears will be over
i shall outline my own way again!
i'm walking to the door
open it and look behind for the last time...
but he's at the doorstep  this can't be real
he's surprised because he notices my bags
immediately he grabs my wrists and pushes me inside
i realise i'm lost...
o no, what have you done?
what have you done?
where is your self respect?
you've defiled our honour and your throth
you crossed the line
you won't get out this time
you won't get out
there's no other solution
then requite you for this insult
but he's at the doorstep  this can't be real
he's surprised because he notices my bags,
immediately he grabs my wrists and pushes me inside
while he's reading the letter i realise i'm lost...
faded beauty, her body trembles...
the scars of this dream will always be remembered
in the imperium with emerald valleys
there where endlessness encircles you
a goddess lost her aureole
created her own domain
this valley of doom where i'm the token
she'll be throwing the dice this time
a goddess lost her aureole
evil took over her godless soul
swallowing you in the rivers of blood
morbid games played with you, you token
clouds are roaming around the pale moon
an inimical gloom covers the valleys
i'm the cephalic empress of this doomed celestial empire
hear the orchestra of death
i wade in blood in search for my inevitable death
the dice are rolling now
when the fate leaves you behind
and drags me off to an unknown destination
shall my tears shape a sea
on which your boat has to reach the area
when the storm is most violent
and the horizon seems to be far away
you will find strength to go on
and conquer the misery that wants to
bring you down, down, down, down
when silence from afar is close at hand
our harmony becomes as elusive as time
viribus exhaustus sentio meum finem
meam amicam viduam relinquens
viribus exhaustus sentio meum finem
meam amicam viduam relinquens
oh, oh, oh
viribus exhaustus sentio meum finem
meam amicam viduam relinquens
when silence from afar is close at hand
our harmony becomes as elusive as time
is there something you feel?
is there something you furtively know?
under the spell of science,
can we declare?
can we allow ourselves to experience?
can we be openminded enough?
won't we fear what we cannot defy?
do we need to declare?
break the force of habit!
why can't you see?
fear will impede you to break through your trivial life
and find the missing aim to evolve
is this the frontier, our zenith?
can we be receptive to our ignorance?
will or won't we be able to reveal?
dulled senses and the need for proven theories
has masked our natural insight in life
and mysteries
life is discussed and measurable
every aberration is observed with agony and suspicion
until it is declared again
she kept her beauty she kept her beauty concealed
concealed behind a curtain behind a curtain of suspense
and endures her fate and endures her fate
moulded by an ancient culture
the honour wasn't allowed the honour wasn't allowed
to be injured to be injured
she is going to live
she is going to live as her
community expects her to
i find myself confined, between furtive desires and feelings of guilt
these are my last words
i'm gonna leave you
i can't stand your narrow mindedness any longer
forgive me...
who am i at night when my eyes are closed tight?
who am i and where when i see far beyond?
every border, every dream, every hidden memory
every nightmare, truth or dare
who do i see
now!
look at me,
tell me what you see
are we just being everyone?
where am i?
tell me, would you go?
i should stay
where am i, where am i?
and where should i go tonight?
every night a different thing,
every time you're in a different dream
am i me there, what am i?
who will i be
now!
look at me,
tell me what you see
are we just being everyone?
look at me,
tell me what you see
are we being everyone?
i cry, i fall
i love, i hate
i know many, though no face ever stays
i breathe, i fly
i kill, i die
though there's nothing that i know
noone can recall where i have been or who i was
look at me,
tell me what you see
are we being everyone?
look at me,
tell me what you see
are we just being everyone?
look at me,
tell me what you see
are we being everyone?
come join your inner wonderland
a place of all you don't understand
come join this labyrinth deep within
the place of all miracles of your mind
come join the magic, the power that you create
come be aware it's an illusion you have made
come join the flow that guides you through a restless mind
come join the flow that moves the night
you've passed the gates now, the door to inner wonderland
you've passed the gates made to create the borders of your dream
come enter further, do you dare?
come face the hell you daily bear
come pass the borders of what's real
come touch and see and feel
come join the flow that guides you through a restless mind
come join the flow that moves the night
come join the flow that guides you through a restless mind
come join the flow that moves the night
come, join, enter
come join this flow
come join us, all here within your mind
come join the magic, your body is weightless

and while the night enbraces you, you deal with the day
come join the flow that guides you through a restless mind
come join the flow that moves the night
come join the flow that guides you through a restless mind
come join the flow that moves the night
thy gruesome cries so thin
on thus you will succeed
the amorphous illusions
thwart your willingness to believe
the beauty disturbed
the amulet, opener of forgotten doors
leads back to that doomed tiaranight
see thyself wild in hysteria
death's irony
the beauty disturbed
listen to this tortuous threnody
filled with the pain
thou can see where betrayal shall bring thee
death's obligatory
where all elements melt to one
and odious memories perish together with you
should have seen the omen, the mirror
death's reality
cry, your threnody will be heard
for thy suffocated minds
the tortuous sound as angels' voices
the phobia, in search for ancestral blood
an arable force from the past
leads back to the atrocious roots
the deep inner soul, never to be exposed
the axiom you can't deny or better
drags you down into a lost abyss
the hymn stops, fear will reign
death's cruelty
there's no time for us
there's no place for us
what is this thing that builds our dreams
yet slips away from us
who wants to live forever
who wants to live forever
there's no chance for us
it's all decided for us
this world has only one sweet moment set aside for us
who wants to live forever
who wants to live forever
who dares to love forever
oh ooh woh, when love must die
touch my tears with your lips
touch my world with your fingertips
and we can live forever
and we can love forever
forever is our today
who wants to live forever
who wants to live forever
forever is our today
who waits forever anyway?
see my life, the failure, you'll make the same mistakes
a child, marriage, your choices, they're all in your hands
where were you when i needed you
your interference is not welcome now
i can't believe these words
showing feelings that he never had,such a human behaviour
did she teach him these feelings of hate
stop! i want you to listen
there is so much at stake
the child, victim of choices
she could never make
i listened but you never spoke
this child is not yours
what are they talking about
her voice full of compassion
she's warning of things from the past
a victim of choices
give her a chance to explain why she's here
she will interfere with all that we are
maybe her fear is a sign she's for real
her fear is too late,she is to blame
fighting and blaming, they don't know much more
it scares and excites me, the past repeats itself
no! we're all victims
i try to feel and understand
that their distant past is like my life today
it's a circle, a curse
i am one of the victims
one of their, one of your victims
i know i'm alone, but somebody's watching me
follows me everywhere i go
a cold flow surprised me again, i shiver
the presence of something i can hear it's breathing
leave me alone, wherever you came from
hearing so much voices, no one's talking
oh leave me alone
leave me alone, wherever you came from
hearing so much voices, no one's talking
waiting for something, nothing in the black of the night
creeps around you, the invisible force that makes you crazy
i can't remember how it feels to be warm, to be alone...
without that fear deep inside me
icons of death float on beyond me
whispering my name and breathing my fear...
the menace of insanity
inner voices cry out for action
defenceless as i am
lost in the alleged paradise
i'm not sure if i am here or elsewhere
searching for satisfaction
beyond the frontiers of my comprehension
leave me alone, wherever you came from
hearing so much voices, no one's talking
leave me alone, wherever you came from
hearing so much voices, no one's talking
oh leave me alone
the storm sings through the mountains
while the rain is falling
a tomb opens itself and lights up the dreary dark valley
the warm spirits fill him, the enchantment of his glory past
hear his low voice whisper
feel his powers
change the light of darkness
his sanctity, his strength
he will rule like before the tomb closed
tainted souls live again
the sweet vengeance versus the black spirits of evil
into the light, back into death, now it is time!
it will depend on the righteous or doomed
like once before opened this tomb, for the revenge is mine
the eyes, looking so cold
condemn failure
and seek for perfection
will never be attained
they're judging the denying face which stares back
a bewildered revelation
show me objectivity
and let these eyes judge again
you cannot touch what you can't ever obtain
i'm inexhaustible
as well as empty in my bitter search
my words are yours,
my voice speaks for your thoughts
i am your mirror without remorse,
your reflection without doubts
i fall and fall
i must learn from the bruises
the scars will be my guide
there's no excuse in ignorance
no time for weakness or regret
face your mirror without doubt
your reflection without remorse
if knowledge was wisdom
and wisdom the key to inner rest
teach me...
love is a razor and i walked the line on that silver blade
slept in the dust with his daughter, her eyes red with
the slaughter of innocence
but will pray for her
i will call her name out loud
i would bleed for her
if only i could see her now
living on a razors edge
balancing on a ledge
living on a razors edge
repeat: x4
the evil that men do lives on and on...
jack in a box and here i am
you're favourite mirror and your only honest reflection and your
guide
i am you deepest fear, the one you'll always hear
i am the devil in disguise, i am your dream
i am the sneaky connection to your most devilish reflection
the scary imagination of the real you
i represent what you deny
you're never scared so why are you running away
from the temptation of my words
oh you don't know what i could do for you
or i could put you through...
and you don't really understand that only fear leads this game
face your demons
hear that inner voice
it calls, it cries for you
just listen well
i'm the one who'll tell terrifying, scary, dreadful tales
you'd better listen
that's some free advice
so what scares you the most
let me know, be a good host
i want to tell you how your fear looks and how to play this game
face your demons
hear that inner voice
it calls, it cries for you
just listen well
i'm the one who'll tell terrifying, scary, dreadful tales
war is breaking loose, it cannot be stopped
cars are racing by and you're getting crushed
friends are dying slow with a lot of pain
you just fear it all
bleeding from a wound that you cannot see
and you're seeing things that can never be
god is not made up and he wants revenge
you just fear it all
fear
you just fear, you can only fear
face your demons
so did you know that all your memories
color all you'll ever be in a dark and misty cloud that i am
floating on
i'm still the voice that speaks inside your head
the demon under your bed
i'm still the one who haunts your soul with devlish lust for
fright
face your demons
hear that inner voice
it calls, it cries for you
just listen well
i'm the one who'll tell scary, dreadful tales
face your demons
hear that inner voice
it calls, it cries for you
just listen well
i'm the one who'll tell terrifying, scary, dreadful tales
as the light's becoming more fierce and the heat is melting your heart
the fire is awakening there's an ancient fear we all know
ominous, misleading, get entangled in yourself
it's a feeling, creeps up, deep within
sweet taste of innocence forgotten
a semblance of confusion
the strength i need is now flowing away
the choking feeling obstructs everything
so erratic in search for the truth
the pain is strong and persists
silence was just a diversion to come out on the hard truth again
leaving this world of illusions seen through the eyes of the innocent
confronted with the infinity of chaos, forcing you to rearrange
when your litanies are unheard
phantasm becomes coldly real
there's a thin line between the world of illusion and reality
a purgatoric trip through the mirrors within you
unconsciousness beholden
o mi jesu, demitte nobis debita nostra,
salva nos ab igne inferiori, perduc in caelum
omnes animas, praesertim eas,
quae misericordiae tuae maxime indigent
sicut erat in principio
et nunc et semper et insaecula
saeculorum
grunts
fantasies, misery came together
in the world of guilt and pain
a neverending game
do not reject me, i was better of without
but in my agonized existence i needed to be free
grunts
free my mind, free my soul
i do not need to feel no more
feel no more, i'm better off this way
alone, far from the past and its brutal face
i still feel the disgust and pain
let me be free
chorus
this is my life today, this is the way it went out of control
i cannot do without these glorifying means, my remedy
these amazing illusions, fantasies
grunts
fanatsy, not for me, like another mirror of reality
another point of view
don't disbelieve me, i really tried to do without
but with sadness as a companion it's hard to do
without the seduction, to become someone i'm not
but in this beautiful deception i'll overcome the night
another day, another week, i'll overcome time
choir
colors seem to flow, they seem to come alive
while the sound of life is stronger than before
it's more than a dream, this is so real
i swim and fly, i never feel more than i need, than i fear
i roam, i cry, i am paralyzed
i can fight the world!
the sense of time is not important now
just like the past, just like right now
there's no illusion that this is for real!
grunts
observe me, control me
tell me what is best, what's good
tell me how it worked for you
tell me how to find myself, find resepct, find the strength
facing life so pure and clean, mean and hard
all these words, can't cure nor heal
plays chorus
come enter, here's my world
closed off from pain and cold
come enter, come inside
a secret place of light
'cause in this world i'm rid of you, you can't get through
so here i am and i'm beautiful
and all my friends would say the same
so here i am and you cannot deny that i am someone you'd embrace
i am the queen i'm pure and loved by everyone
come enter, here's my code
through the world wide wire you'll know me
the queen of her own world
my story meet my life
so now you see, there is another me
not someone insecure and strange
my father's will in here, it doesn't mean a thing
and i don't fear his violent rage
i am the queen you know i'm loved by everyone
come enter, here's my code
through the world wide wire you'll know
the queen of her own world
stop dreaming and wake up
your silly world is not what's real
this world of fake friends
and computers  digital deceit
this cyber wall this cyber wall
is built to break out or hold
the choice is yours the choice is yours,
will you dream or see what's real?
oh...no, no more
just let me be alone with myself
these conflicting thoughts increase my doubts
i am the queen, i must be loved
this socalled 'wall' is there to protect
a life controlled by keys, closed off from pain and cold
digital deceit...
digital, digital, digital...
beauty and destruction
pride and honour
freedom, elimmination
speek out loud, hide
now enter, here is our dreamworld
view the splendid sights
you can always tell we never learned, we'll never learn
blindness and silence
no one dares
action and reprisal
raise your voice, die
now enter, here is our dreamworld
view the splendid sights
you can always tell we never learned, we'll never learn
now enter, here is our dreamworld
view the splendid sights
you can always tell we never learned, we never will
oh how will the earth be seen for the first time?
oh how will the earth feel touched for the first time?
entwine and iconize
passion ignites
suspicion and betrayal
the voice of violence speaks again
now enter, here is our dreamworld
view the splendid sights
you can always tell we never learned, we'll never learn
now enter, here is our dreamworld
view the splendid sights
you can always tell we never learned, we never will
couloured chambers, fine illusions, or a gate to space
endless stairways, fine delusions, all under my command
i'd change the sky to paint it red
i'd change the colours of life, and play with time
it's all mine!
it's only everything, all that i wanted to be
cause it's only everything
and wise, wiser than time, wiser than life, wiser than me, only me...
this is the end of all reason, the inner mirror reveals
there's more beyond what you're sure of, the fantasy of dreams
it's always there, the only emotion we all seem to keep down
there, while exploring dimensions
there is more, only everything
dream! as bright or dark, as warm or hard the mind is set on
dream! you lose control, you lose your freedom to confine it
i don't want to see this, i don't want this pain i never knew before
feel, we're on the loose
impressions are enlarged
i don't want to hear this, i don't want to dream to feel this again
or to get a taste
this could be the end of all reason, the inner mirror reveals
there's more beyond what you're sure of, the fantasy of dreams
it's always there, the only emotion we all seem to keep down
there, still exploring dimensions
there is more, only everything
become me, come feel along with all you see
control me, control the keys
do you dare to be
so deep, will you surrender now to your sleep?
relive your daydreams and
come join this inner wonderland
come let every emotion stand
to be right under your command
to let out fantasies
to change them into mysteries
where time loses all memories
to luck and bitter agony
relive your daydreams awake
so join the magic of your life
just dare to take the inner drive
to see it's only everything you can be doing tonight
dream! as cool or hot, as smooth or rough the mind's creating
dream! enjoy the ride, enjoy the boundless journey you can make
i can be the maker, i can be the queen of time and twisted games
see you're on the loose
images enlarged
i will need no reason
i just need the mirror inside me to reveal what's down below
this must be the end of all reason, the inner mirror reveals
there's more beyond what you're sure of, the fantasy of dreams
it's always there, the only emotion we all seem to keep down
there, while exploring dimensions
there is more, only everything
instrumental
i can't look behind because i'm living in the past
tears without emotion are filling up the unbridled hours
we cannot be
what you expect from us
we cannot see through the glasses of despair
evade the leaden legacy
those who separate and join the opposite
do not see that that will get them nowhere
can't you understand it is a similar manipulation
wake up and see the light
doomed to wander in repressed emotions
this imaginary refuge restrains me from awakening
fear of penance
doomed to sycophancy
doomed to sycophancy...
child everything keeps getting worse
the terror at home, the dread at school
i mustn't count on much support,
i'm still locked out it's up to me,
how to face the teasing and the pain
hate, one thing we have in common
play your game
beat me, hurt me
a physical release from mental pain
don't make me explode in your way
contemplative this is a chain of torture,
a line of pain, no other way to show how you feel
this is the rebel in her, the torment from him,
the absence of help, the mother's care
child rage, it burns all around us
blind pain
so abuse is only weakness
it feels more like a cry of distress, an act of incapacity
feel the threat
feel the oppressed ambience of having no place to go,
no one who'll take care of my salvation
contemplative this is a chain of torture,
a line of pain, no other way to show how you feel
this is the rebel in her, the torment from him,
the absence of help, the mother's care
child here comes the final episode
of terror and pain, abuse and hope
here comes the fight between us all
a fight between a love long gone
i'm to blame, but it's their own blind pain

spoken outro:
mother now look where you and your selfish ambitions have gotten us!
it's never been worse! you gotta work, work work, come back without
even noticing me or that ignorant kid of yours! you only think about
yourself.
father i only think about myself, it's me again? you selfcentered bitch!
you're the one complaining all the time, but when that kid freaks out, who's
supposed to take care of her, huh?! besides, it's not my child! wasn't it ours,
our little 'saviour' of a love we never had? a fucking...
mother yeah, there is no 'us' anymore, darling! ever since she was born
and i was left at your apparment raising her, i think about all i ever dreamed
of because of 'our' decisions! we both should have made compromises,
but the only one who did was me!
father oh, there you go again! you feel awfully sorry for yourself why
don't you take a look at my side of the story for once?
mother ah, yeah sure, 'your side'... well, excuse the fuck out of me for being
in your way! a child you never wanted, living in a smaller house than you've
ever dreamed of, and all the while i'm getting old and ugly, right?
you must really long for somebody young and fresh, or if this means already...
father enough!! don't you dare accuse me of being unfaithful! that's
how you ruined my loyalty i can't believe i once fell in love with a...
mother oh, neither can i, you bastard! neither can i! and loyal? i dind't
know you're familiar with that word!
father there's a lot you don't know, a lot you'll never understand!
we've lost contact, baby.
mother oh yeah, really? well, that doesn't seem to bother you. why don't
you just go on? go, go! drift off away on that little island of yours and don't
forget to drown on your way to a better life!!
father maybe i will, maybe i will! i'd rather drown than be locked up with
such a freaed up bith and a freaky daughter! i can't believe we're still
holding a conversation about something so stupid!!
mother fine, go! just go!! drown! i hope it'll be slow and painful!
father shut your fucking mouth!
mother asshole... asshole!

is it not the choosing that makes the life we live so intricate?
are the options we have too endless to control?
can we oversee the offers and their demands and their goals?
can we oversee our own needs if we do not know
what it is we really want?
our minds, instead of our hearts
what we feel confuses our thoughts
security, an ancient quest
standing alone, the ultimate test
still we reach for warmth in the materialized luxuries in life
the times have changed but we are stille the same
another choice 'cause we still don't know
chorus
let me see where i belong
let me be a little part of it
can i choose my way in life?
can i dream, can i feel, could i know my choice?
a choice without the illusion that luck is for sale
'cause i have all that money can buy
choir:
a choice means freedom
and endless options
can we survey that?
can freedom be controlled?
the option's bitter
it leaves a part of you behind the borders of your choice
chorus
let me see where i belong
let me be a little part of it
can i choose my way in life?
can i dream, can i feel, could i know my choice?
let me see where i belong
let me be a little part of it
can i choose my way in life?
can i dream, can i feel, could i know my choice?
diving in the lake of thousand faces
every sign seems a delusion
and fills me with doubt
i shouldn't look for certainty
among these disorderly impressions
but still i do...
being estranged
slowly i loose the grip on the reality
time shall shatter what we have built up
being estranged
from the reliable
don't even recognize the warmth
you always fulfilled me with
break through my crystallized sphere and hold me
enter my deepest inner self
imprison the pain
besieging in vain
it feels like i'm in the middle of a movie
gazing at the script
it shows me new insights
delighted by the bygone sufferings
but already waiting for the next ones
i bend forward and look between the ripples of the lake
it's the leading character...
break through my crystallized sphere and hold me
wherever you are
deceitful memories mingled with reality
i hold myself to the timeless spell
fascinated by never knowing if it really happened
they told you not to yield to temptation
and opened their arms,
make your own inferences...
inscrutable chaos in my head, inevitably
greed will take its toll
why?
there's no place to hide
let me free myself
the anathema's driving millions,
together in the pustules of our earth
greed and selfdenial,
the cause of unimpeded desecration of the truth
they told you not to yield to temptation,
but offered you only hypocrisy and ruin
the phantom of damnation
threw her coat over humanity
they told you not to yield to temptation,
but offered you only hypocrisy and ruin
they told you not to yield to temptation,
but offered you only hypocrisy and ruin
captive in the shackles of this indoctrination,
depraved souls wished to be pure
delight in deformity,
the last convulsions are building up
a bridge to a new era
the assumption of a faded supposition,
never shall i be a marionette
the embrace that smothers...
i may get along, when love is gone
still, you made your mark, here in my heart
one day i'll fly away
leave your love to yesterday
what more can your love do for me?
when will love be through with me?
i follow the night
can't stand the light
when will will i begin
my life again?
one day i'll fly away
leave your love to yesterday
what more can your love do fot me?
when will love be through with me?
why live life from dream to dream
and dread the day when dreaming ends
behind your facade hides an indomitable
lust for power and tyranny
taking advantage of your pendencies
fear is the doom, doom of us all
instead of exterminating the weed
we allow it to overgrow our function
all means are justified for the "djihad fi sabil allah"
i embrace you, accept my soul
i shall make my life subordinate to you
live like your rules and laws prescribe
and follow you wherever i go
follow in the cry
hang this heretic who's indulged in unchaste thoughts
silence him such as the laws of the vellums prescribe
pusillanimous massacres the order of the day
on behalf of powerhungry fundamentalists
the ordeal has begun
to oblige the unknown, within me
as i drown
cannot remember, cannot think
as i sink, deep...
near the monolith of doubt
creeps the fear
the fear to lose yourself
in the severe reflection
i don't know
a flashing moment that has frozen me
my whole existence passed by
through the trusted eyes of a mirror
but it wasn't me i could see
this monolith of everything that i have been
is vacillated and aghast
the inexorable time has taught me once again
that my features will change and macerate me
see, it's me, my monolith of doubt
you're the worst of all,
with all your accusations and compunction
i can't suffer this duress,
from someone so deprayed and selfish
you embody all that i've been through
without you i am sure i will be loved
my existence conforms to your distress
your ambition, the cause of mine
a disruption, i'm nothing, even less
misfortunes never come singly and i was there to stay
you don't allow me a single place,
nor any love into your lives
an unperceived, annoying presence you'd rather ignore
but in my life you know you'll leave... a beautiful emptiness
where you used to be
impotent screams will turn
into the love of silence
my liberation, then silence,
will be perfect and pure
it's all in my dreams,
i'll remove you
and all our mutual disgust
in my dreams,
i solve the problem by removing it
my wish is to see you grovel,
like you once forced me to
there's no other way, here's my course of life
a path without the sickening trace of you
i need the beauty of a cleared, pure world
this eternal interruption of your rash life can save me
you don't allow me a single place,
nor any love into your lives
an unperceived, annoying presence you'd rather ignore
but in my life you know you'll leave... a beautiful emptiness
it's sad to feel you don't believe in love,
it's sad that you're so cold
and i'll be the same,
if you keep on poisoning my life
drowning in selfsacrificing visions
when you're gone, then we will all be released
it's sad my life has been like hell so far,
it's sad that you're the cause
and i'll be cured in this beautiful, empty world
floating, floating away with your perilous visions and hate
when you're gone, silence will fill up the emptiness
when you're gone, we all will be released
in my dreams i shall rinse my body and soul
my wish,
the accomplishment lies here before me in my hands
i will be released from your accusing eyes
and torrents of verbal abuse
you'll know the causes are your own mistakes
while life flows out of you
and exempts me forever!
my mind is under an attack,
although no one sees
my past is pounding in the back of my memories
it's always there to poison my mind with all i do
feelings i know so well seem to come back
as if nothing's ever changed
fear was one of the reasons to crawl away into a world i lost
i know the rules,i play the game
but somehow it always stays the same
in spite of my will,in spite of my hope,in spite of it all
so for those who believe in this life,
spand right on this circlemust be round
every turn has its vortex,you'll drown if nobody warns you
and shows you another circle of life
nothing will change,
nothing is done for the victim i am forced to remain
cause these days make you feel,and you are,on your own
study,work hard,marry,reproduce and become the perfect model
can you stand the test of time if life is a vicious circle
without the mirror of another path
so for those who believe in this life
stand right on the circlemust be round
every turn has its vortex,you'll drown if nobody warns you
and shows you another circle of life
at night, assimilate life
in the infinite realm
of our intrinsic side
find, the missing parts of the mind
the hidden truth behind
our dungeon of thoughts, this labyrinth
search, it has a reason and a meaning
remembered and repeated
a guide, not to be ignored
feel, there's so much to feel
amnesia must confiscate an elusive link
to consciousness
it's there cause there's so much we don't know
even our own true face
it's there, facing what we can't have
our ideals ain't true, naked and exposed
to the bareness of what's real
boundless fantasy, becomes reality
as we breathe water and run through the sand
whispers and a scream, flying high, falling down
and a face with no features or name
exposed to live, we can only divine
tell me, what's your reality?
the game is over, time has taught life
open your eyes and embrace our socalled paradise
all the notions and thoughts
devise a way to make it yours
the enigma of a reason
how can life be what you want it to be
find the emphasis in your own reality
deviate from the search with episodic glimpses
of a spectrum no one can see or feel, nor declare
slowly become aware life knows its prophecies
find the emphasis in your own reality
in all life you see
a sudden shifting of events
what's coincidence, what's faith?
the ambiguity makes the sense of our destiny worth searching for
what can it induce?
if our being was omniscient?
there's so much you'll never know, but
your life will be what you want it to be
find the emphasis in your own reality
an old man is proud
but behind his modest smile lies the grief
only one picture of his brave son remains
it seems that the vicious circle
can never be broken through
the hopeful ones gathered their strength
to achieve the apparent impossible
but all plans seem to be in vain
as a soldier of allah
he's an example for the others
on his bloody way to immortality
it seems that the vicious circle
can never be broken through
because old wounds are reopened every time
this intifada as a device
to thwart the peace negotiations
he can rely on a reward in the hereafter
eternal paradise awaits him
pugnacity
with our blood
show no mercy
with our soul
die for heaven
an eye for an eye
burn to let them...
suffer for all their actions
we will not move an inch
they won't play in our hands
we will not tolerate those who defy
we will not hesitate
to start an attack
if you undermine the agreement
let them suffer!
i fight
i sweat
i drag the whole world along
i care
i break
i'm spiritless but strong
my will stands strong
i ache for inspirational and additional hearts to help me fight
deep in my mind lies the map of my destiny
deep in my heart lies the strength to conquer myself
in your nightmares
in your dreams lies the deepest fear
in ambitions
in belief lies the deepest strength
i doubt
don't care
don't see what has ever driven me
a wall
will stand
all rending thoughts can't end
i'm paralyzed but strong
in need of comprihensible but sensational plans to fight
i hear the ticking of the clock
i'm lying here, the room's pitch dark
i wonder where you are tonight
no answer on the telephone
and the night goes by so very slow
oh i hope that it won't end though
alone
till now i always got by on my own
i never really cared until i met you
and now it chills me to the bone
how do i get you alone
you don't know how long i have wanted
to touch your lips and hold you tight
you don't know how long i have waited
and i was going to tell you tonight
but the secret is still my own
and my love for you is still unknown
alone
till now i always got by on my own
i never really cared until i met you
and now it chills me to the bone
how do i get you alone
how do i get you alone
alone
alone
my decision is fixed
the suitcases are packed
i'm laying the letter on the table
tonight, i will be safe and the fears will be over
i shall outline my own way again!
i'm walking to the door
open it and look behind for the last time...
but he's at the doorstep  this can't be real
he's surprised because he notices my bags
immediately he grabs my wrists and pushes me inside
i realise i'm lost...
o no, what have you done?
what have you done?
where is your self respect?
you've defiled our honour and your throth
you crossed the line
you won't get out this time
you won't get out
there's no other solution
then requite you for this insult
but he's at the doorstep  this can't be real
he's surprised because he notices my bags,
immediately he grabs my wrists and pushes me inside
while he's reading the letter i realise i'm lost...
faded beauty, her body trembles...
the scars of this dream will always be remembered
mother here i am, the future is mine
father and mine as well,
we'll stand at the top of a prosperous society
mother our dreams can become reality
both i am in charge of life's great circle
i control my path of wealth
parents ambitions high, burning
the flames burn deep down in our souls
to be known for efficiency and passion
seperate goals but fire shared
father we both need our professions
do what you want but i'll never give up mine
mother oh i can think,
i can work, i don't need your support
our love is pale, but it's not in my way
father i shall become a man of distinction
bothwe can share our lives, our fire
to share our lives, our fire
parents ambitions high, burning
the flames burn deep down in our souls
to be known for efficiency and passion
ambitions, dreams, they're burning
the flames burn deeper towards our goals, our needs
suddenly, we have been careless
a new life, a new dimension
it disturbs our solid future. it puts out the fire we both need
it's a choice between the passion, or the love that can be saved now
see the child here as a saviour. choose for love and let this life begin
father we have been careless but you have provoked it
your weak search for more love between us, a blind emotion
should i believe that this new life can save us,
a saviour, a prodigy, so choose for love and let this life begin

spoken interlude:
father look, we have to consider this carefully, right?
we never really thought about having a baby.
mother i know we never thought about it before, but i think we have
to find a way to keep this baby. there's more to life than just having a
succesful career!
father no! that career is what we've worked for! i haven't got the time
to raise a brat!
mother but... this baby could bring us together again. and we'll still have
time left to do the things we've always wanted.
father you think so? if we wanna keep it, would you be able to take care
of it and keep your job?
mother well, i think we'll both need to compromise. but if we work together...
i mean, we're still young, we can manage it!
father don't pressure me!

contemplative see a birth, a saviour, a curse
see these lives, they see this as a choice between their life together,
between love and fire
father with this child we must make choices, it can save us if we want
we have a life together, no choice between love and fire
mother feel it, this life in me, moving
with this child we must make choices, it can save us if we want
oh, i fear it, the path we take
is this a choice anyway, between love and fire?
parents ambitions high, burning
the flames burn deep down in our souls
to be known for efficiency and passion
ambitions, dreams, they're burning
the flames burn deeper towards our goals, our needs
withering time, so elusive, so shapeless
graceful coil, crumbling glory, it will revive
exalt the endless chain
exalt the withering times
time decides what lives or dies
time can crawl and time can fly
it can wither and erase
it can make a new beginning
there is nothing time can't beat
there is nothing time will need
to destroy and bloom again
a vicious circle older than the earth
decay, destroy to reform again
withering time
withering time, so elusive, so shapeless
graceful coil, crumbling glory, it will revive
exalt the endless chain
exalt the withering times
broken windows, blistering paint
lashing winds, hot suns and rain
wood has splintered, walls are cracked
the elements are just as vicious
all what men have made won't last
in the future as in the past
but our memories are strong
and will outlive all circles of time
time, transcend beyond all life, transcend beyond
on until the end of time, on and on
live before we waste our time, before we run out
broken, blistering, lashing, splintering
cracking, crawling, flying, withering time
withering time, so elusive, so shapeless
graceful coil, crumbling glory, it will revive
withering time, so elusive, so shapeless
graceful coil, crumbling glory, it will revive
exalt the endless chain
exalt the withering times
you need to get out of my sight
a lonely heart can beat
you're too dangerous
a lonely heart can bleed
i cannot stand it, to be enclosed and isolated
a lonely heart can be enclosed but isolated
you're too much
a lonely heart is weak
too dependent
a broken heart will seek
you take the life out of me
no heart is broken forever
it's broken promises
but my faith is broken forever
can't you believe that this power we feel can be for real?
the power that was given light now seems to freeze but why?
a lonely heart will break
pressure will make me forsake you
a lonely heart won't forsake me
as if we're both the same
wounded and beaten but still not defeated
a lonely heart can be wounded and beaten but still not defeated
'cause i won't let you in
so if it's all for real
your weakness will be my strength
your heart should be melting
you might be lonely
but i am not beloved and bounded forever
because we're all the same
beloved and bounded forever
can't you believe that this power we feel can be for real?
the smile that was given light now seems to freeze but why?
won't you believe?
won't you embrace it?
can't you believe
the power between us?
oh, discord, see them fail, oh
won't you believe?
won't you embrace it?
can't you believe in the power between us?
can't you believe that this power we feel can be for real?
the power that was given light now seems to freeze but why?
life, at its best, you are doing fine
but you're blind, it's china you hold
as it breaks, suddenly it's clear
beautiful but transitory
but we won't break easy
we won't give in to all unbearable pain
we'll pull through, we won't crack
we'll endure and survive
oh, transitory
pain is as life itself
evanescent as it fades
transitory
life, all you've got, all was swept away
now you see what there is to miss
suddenly you're stronger than you thought
as you know it's transitory
'cause we won't break
survival is all we've got
and our unbearable grief
we'll hold on and won't crack
and we'll value all life
oh, transitory
pain is as life itself
evanescent as it fades
cry with a smile
my heart is bleeding, bewildered, i'm here alone
why is there pain in a beautiful moment?
why do i feel so lost, so empty?
cry with a smile
my heart is healing from pain i knew that would come
why is there luck in a deeply sad moment?
why do i feel so calm, so peaceful?
take my heart and set it free
take my heart and give it time to heal
i know in my memories you'll live
take my heart a little while
take it with you to the place you'll go
i know we will meet again someday
cry with a smile
my heart was dreaming of time i knew would come to an end
why do i cry about a beautiful memory?
why do i feel so hurt, so lonely?
welcome, and wake up
this is not a dream but something in between that and reality
wake up if you dare
this is not the regular nightmare
before your eyes the world will change
slowly take you down to unknown places
welcome to a world that's only yours
wake up if you dare and just follow me!
leave me alone
my dreams speak to me or am i still awake?
leave me alone
i'm my own threat, i'm a victim of my mind
let go
i fooled you, i warned you though
i won't let go before you've dreamed all your dreams
i'll play you
you want me to
you ask for more
you want to know
leave me now, i need to know i'm in control
leave me alone
leave me be within my private fantasies
let go
i told you you, i won't let go
i want to show you what dreams can do for you
they'll free you, they'll open doors
they show you all you want to know
as some is light and some is dark, dreams can be both
they have two sides
fear
i am your fear deep inside
fear
face all your fears deep in this dream
we are the dark side of your mind
pain
i am your pain deep inside
pain
feel all your pain deep in this dream
feel it's a part of you
you are like your dreams, both light as dark
come with us now and explore
silence, i'm here
no words, no sounds, no pain or doubts
i'm floating
even time itself can never touch me
i am free
silence, i'm here
no voices, no music
i'm roaming through this soundless place
leave me here where i am free
doubt
i am your doubt deep inside
i am all you try to hide
hate
i am your hate deep inside
i am your mirror, your fright
energized by nightly views
you are the dream, the dream is you
aah
so face it, you know i'm right
you have no reason to resent me and fight
you are me and i am you
the other side of the sleepy truth
leave me please, how can i rest with you inside?
leave me alone, i'm too tired for these crazy theories
let go
i'll leave you, but won't let go, for i am part of all you'll ever do
i'll help you, i'll open doors and show you all you need to know
for i'm your dream energizer
here, here in this heart it's cold
cold as stone
must welcome these memories
as shallow as my eyes have slowly become
hearts, frail heart left broken
cold and known for its bitter agony
here are the memories as empty as my life has slowly become
sting, crush and bite in my soul
my heart bleeds
times changed forever that night
leaving only empty memories
empty memories won't heal the pain
we know only sorrow
there's no future in tomorrow
all our hopes were buried too young
for the years that should have followed
we know only hatred
there's no future in our anguish
for all hope is buried with life
and reprisal will be ours
it's empty
we're empty
they're empty memories
here, here in this heart
cold as stone, for no feelings there to warm
it is as empty as our dreams and hopes
now our future is gone
it stings and bites in my soul
my heart bleeds
times changed forever that night
leaving only empty memories
time was changed forever that night
leaving me, no, no, no, alone with empty memories
empty memories
empty memories
so wild, so beautiful and pure
all elements divine
the essence of all life
so vast, extensive and remote
unbridled and erratic
savage but glorious
it bursts, its energy is stirring
it calls, its drawing power
will enchant us with its might
its massive spirits bright
let it flow
its endless beauty will evoke
a timeless sequence we all share
we cannot break through nor control
but to feel its true soul
dare to concede and to connect
emerging waves and brightened skies
the sun that burns in your eyes
the wind that blows and pounds
it shines, its energy is whirling
it fights, will not be interfered with people
who can't feel, it is all nature's flow
let it flow
it's endless beauty will evoke
a timeless sequence we all share
we cannot break through nor control
we should cherish it
oh, energy
oh, evoke me
let it flow
its endless beauty will evoke
a timeless sequence we all share
we cannot break through nor control
it is not at our command, no
i see it
i hear but cannot know how you are feeling
i sense it but can't comprehend
he's standing there
waiting for the news to hear, what's wrong with her
his feelings go way beyond my own
only sense it, only imagine their fate
just envision, the only way to relate
we try to
we say so but we can only imagine
we want to but can't empathize
she's lying there crying
for the truth was stronger than her pain
her feelings go way beyond my own
only sense it
only imagine their fate
just envision, the only way to relate for real
only sense it
only imagine their fate
just envision, the only way to relate
can we sense it?
can we imagine their fate?
just envision, there is no way we relate for real
you fake, you give nothing but misery
you are reluctant in your vanity
your eyes are blinded by your conceit
you turn my fire into negative energy!
you are estranged by your jealousy
a weakness in your personality
your lack of social skills annoy me
you fuel my hate by your negative energy
i see a false alliance causing all this pain
i see a sick relation ending up in vain
i see a world at war because of pride and might
i feel we're all getting deenergized
i am amazed by your ability
to make me feel all this insanity
i am discouraged by your falsity
you sink so low to get things done your way
i see a false alliance causing all this pain
i see a sick relation ending up in vain
i see a world at war because of pride and might
i feel we're all getting deenergized
unwilling, absent, dissenting
conflicting, adverse, annoying
you're cureless, painless, disgusting
false, ruthless, blinded, recusant
you damage, injure and destroy
unbalanced, troubled and unfaithful
you're senseless, heartless and fearless
cold, hostile, distant and empty
you're a freak
you won't get closer to my dignity
something you've lost, just like empathy
i won't degrade to your pathetic ways
nor let you take any more positive energy
i see a false alliance causing all this pain
i see a sick relation ending up in vain
i see a world at war because of pride and might
i feel we're all getting deenergized
you hypnotize me
i do not dare to look
you mesmerize me
don't even dare to feel
i want to have it just to prove, i can take control
i want to have it just to show them, i won't be fooled
i'll take it, i'll break it or force it just to let them know
who i am, who i am
i should wait and think it over
i don't want to push, that is not
who i am, who i am
i'll softly touch this
i'll fire up this flame
i'll hold on gently
it's time to lead the game
i want to have it just to prove, i can take control
i want to have it just to show them, i won't be fooled
i'll take it, i'll break it or force it just to let them know
who i am, who i am
i should wait and think it over
i don't want to push, that's not
who i am, who i am
i want to have it, i want to break it
and take it, or force it just to let them know
who i am, who i am
i should wait and think it over
i don't want to push, oh, no, that's not
who i am, who i am
